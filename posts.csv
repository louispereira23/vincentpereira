"Unwanted Solutions","Advice for a better tomorrow often focuses on the past. Yet, in the grand scheme of cosmic time, our lives are incredibly brief. Embrace life as it is without seeking constant solutions.
 
 Don't worry about being labeled good or bad; acknowledge yourself and your desires. Remember that sometimes people seek solutions when there aren't any problems to solve. 
 The influx of unsolicited advise via WhatsApp further exacerbates it, almost compelling one to find a problem.","musings, random"
"India's Secular Stabilizer","India's secular nature is not due to its minority, but rather its majority. The Hindu majority prevents the country from becoming a single-religion theocracy. Despite concerns about changes in India, it remains steadfast in its values because of this religious majority.
 
 In other countries with one dominant religion, many have become theocratic. Although India faces many problems, they don't stem from the majority wanting systemic change. Instead, these issues arise from fractured mandates in democratic elections.
 
 Without such divisions, no party could gain enough power to alter India's constitution significantly. Few people may try to change our country's ethos. But while the constitution may evolve over time, India will remain true to itself and maintain its core values of ""Sab ke saath, Sab ka vikas"".",musings
"Trust Your Judgment","Relying too much on others' advice can weaken your own judgment. When facing challenges, you might struggle to apply these principles. 
 Instead, seek answers within yourself; you often know what's best for you.
 
 Focus on discovering your true desires in life, whether it's related to studies, career, or relationships. Be genuinely nice instead of pretending; even if people don't respond positively, you'll feel good within.",musings
"Loneliness in a Material World","Loneliness is a growing issue reaching almost epidemic levels. What causes this feeling? It's not simply being alone, as one can feel lonely even in a crowd. Loneliness stems from our thought processes and the beliefs we hold about ourselves.
 
 When people focus on exclusivity, believing they are important or superior due to wealth or status‚ they may isolate themselves. This self-imposed isolation can lead to loneliness if there's no one around to challenge their views or share experiences with them.
 
 It's crucial for individuals to recognize that they're part of the larger human tribe and should connect with others rather than seeking separation. There's nothing wrong with aspiring for wealth; however, it shouldn't create an exclusive mindset where accumulating possessions takes priority over forming relationships.
 
 Society often places celebrities on pedestals, leading to envy and jealousy among those who desire similar lifestyles. But it's essential to remember that material possessions have price tags but not intrinsic value. Feeling connected and fulfilled comes from understanding what truly matters in life – relationships, personal growth, and embracing our shared humanity.",musings
"My Parent's Anniversary","Today is a special day in my life, as it's not only Mother's Day but also the wedding anniversary of my parents. I recently came across their marriage details written by our father in our family Bible, and it has made me quite nostalgic.
 
 Though I knew they married young, the records confirmed that our dad was 24 and our mother just 21 when they tied the knot in Bombay. I'm unsure about how many people from Diwar attended their wedding, but I know that my auntie and my mother's family were present.
 
 The expectations during that era were different; companionship seemed to be more important than high ambitions. This makes me reflect on how sometimes small things matter much more than what we can hold on to in life.","family, memories, musings"
"Happiness Within","Yesterday, I took my usual walk with my dog and crossed paths with a man probably in his late 70s. He had a calm demeanor, wearing a neatly pressed shirt that seemed to reflect the peace he felt within himself. His serene expression made me wonder what he was thinking and reminded me of a saying – Getting off at the next stop .
 
 In today's world, many people appear to be unhappy or dissatisfied after their prime age. Instead of finding inner peace, they blame their problems on external factors like authorities or other individuals. Social gatherings often turn into discussions where people complain about their surroundings rather than focusing on finding happiness within themselves.
 
 I've come to realize that frustration stems from our own dissatisfaction rather than outside sources. If someone isn't happy with themselves, they' often look for reasons to blame others as an escape from facing their own issues.
 
 It's important for us to take time and reflect deeply on how we can improve our lives by making our worlds smaller and more focused on ourselves and our families. We shouldn't try solving global problems when there are unresolved issues in our personal lives.",musings
"Dirty Paws","During a casual conversation with a friend, we both discovered our shared love for dogs. My friend mentioned that they changed their floor tiles to brown because they didn't want to see the dirt their dog brought in. However, I have white tiles and my dog comes in often as well. Instead of hiding the dirt, I prefer cleaning it up.
 
 Over time, it became difficult to clean the dirt every time my dog came inside. So I adjusted my mindset and started viewing my dog's paw prints as works of art, which put me at ease until it's cleaned. This change made me question if I was genuinely embracing this new perspective or just doing so out of convenience.
 
 Ultimately, who is right? Should one install brown tiles to mask the dirt or keep white ones that display paw prints more visibly? The answer remains uncertain.",musings
"Siblings","We often focus on major breakthrough and overlook the smaller things in life, such as the kind gestures we receive from others. In my case, I am fortunate to have had nine siblings, six of whom live within close proximity. This allows us to exchange thoughtful gestures like sharing homemade delicacies.
 
 In a time when families are becoming more nuclear and there's less warmth in our surroundings, having siblings nearby is a true luxury. I wish for future generations to experience at least 50% of this closeness and connection that I enjoy with my family.","family, musings"
"Revitalizing Democracy","Democracy Needs Change
 
 Election time used to be exciting with canvassing starting a month in advance, loudspeakers announcing the upcoming date, and passionate slogans filling the air. Meetings at the main square were customary, engaging not only eligible voters but also younger generations who could gauge voter preferences based on meeting attendance. People eagerly voted for governance instead of rulers.
 
 However, this enthusiasm is now missing as people choose rulers and surrender their power. Democracy needs reforms to revitalize its process:
 
 1. Limit elected officials to two tenures (continuous or otherwise).
 2. Lower the voting age to sixteen.
 3. Implement primary and secondary voting where top two candidates in the primaries compete in the secondary round for majority approval, avoiding situations where someone wins with less than a majority.
 4.Once elected, ban defection to other parties, instead, only allow resignation accompanied by a forced five year break from political activities.
 
 Some may argue against these changes due to expenses involved; however, investing in democracy is just as crucial as investing in our defense budget for securing our nation's future.",musings
"Gathering in Numbers","At a farewell party for Neha last night, I was struck by the joy of numbers. Not simply from counting the parties or the guests , but from the emotional connections they represent which is minus guests. Born into a large family where gatherings are in tens rather than units, what others see as a crowd is our normality. This abundance often taken for granted now holds more value as the young are spreading in different directions to pursue education or careers.
 
 This shift has made me appreciate these moments and anticipate nuclear families becoming their norm too. Having experienced such abundant gatherings will hopefully remind them in reinforcing our shared joy of numbers.","family, memories, musings"
"Reflections at a Funeral","At a colleague's funeral, I found myself standing before the niche of Maria Carlotta de Rego Aguiar. I'd seen this face many a times but today it dawned on me that she is my great-grandmother on my mother's side. It brought home the fact that I owe my existence to this woman – a sobering realization indeed.
 
 Looking around at lifelong friends attending mass with me, it was clear how time had etched its mark on us all. Our shapes altered, walks slowed and looks changed; life is certainly different from our youthful days.
 
 Gazing at the church, I pondered if my great-grandmother had walked this very path when things were starkly different. Being in our shared birthplace felt like an indulgence; connecting myself to several generations rooted here made me feel deeply native.
 
 Today reinforced that embracing one's roots creates a strong sense of belonging, something we often neglect but should cherish instead.","family, memories, musings"
"Driving to Panjim","I've observed how my feelings fluctuate based on varying circumstances. For instance, I endured a dreadful drive in Panjim yesterday. It took one hour for me to cover just five kilometers. As usual complaining about the incompetence of the officials was stressful. While they seemed to revel in it, I was the one punishing myself.
 
 On the contrary, today's early morning's journey back to Panjim, to take part for an EV Rally was delightful. Despite traveling on same road as yesterday (minus the jam), listening to soothing music enhanced my travel experience and sparked some introspection. Had I listened to music yesterday the outcome would have been different.
 
 We often merely anticipate life's best offerings rather than actively seeking them.
 
 This contrast between yesterday and today illustrates that difference: expecting versus pursuing life's rewards. Yesterday was about expectation; today emphasized pursuit. The key is not simply to expect but also strive for life's best, it puts you in control.",musings
"Expanding Neighborhoods","The definition of a neighborhood has changed, for the worse. Previously, neighbors existed within a square kilometer and we navigated all events, good or bad, within this boundary. This system fostered mutual understanding without disrupting personal peace.
 
 However, the advent of WhatsApp has blurred these borders. Unwanted information invades our homes uninvited, becoming an unwelcome norm. Recent examples include local disputes or priestly opinions that would previously remain unknown to us; now they consume unnecessary time in late-night discussions.
 
 It's essential to be selective about what you allow into your consciousness, unless you wish to spoil life's pleasant moments.","musings, random"
"Mastering Happiness","Happiness relies on mental cultivation. Our minds, akin to monkeys, leap in various directions; remember that you alone are its master. Train it to embrace thoughts that maintain your cheerfulness.
 
 While ""practice makes perfect"" is a familiar saying, we often apply it solely to physical activities. Pause and practice invoking the right trigger for positive emotions. Though short lived at first, repetition will enhance your happiness proficiency.
 
 
 In Konkani, it is said:
 Zhem tum monan ghalta, tosoch tuzo sounsar choltha.

"On Death","Death Speaks:
 
 Why am I maligned in life, yet glorified once I strike? Humanity ought to recognize that life's splendor exists due to me. Without my presence, life itself would cease. People must comprehend that I am the cause for celebrating life - all this without expense or petition.
 
 All they need do is relish their time. Do not inquire how long; it is not intended to be known. 
 Fear me not, though many succumb to this misperception.
 
 Rather than fretting about your destination after death, wonder where you came from. To that place, I shall return you.",musings
"Acceptance is Serenity","Living life without anxiety is best achieved through acceptance, particularly in trying times. It is only human for us to feel devastated upon hearing unexpected news, these are the moments our brains secrete less of the biochemical which excites us . Owing to our upbringing, we often entertain the same thought a thousand times, potentially leading to depression.
 
 At such instances, applying logic is crucial. While easier said than done, this is mainly because we rarely give it a chance. Take a moment to envision your near future – you know you will eventually overcome these feelings. So, what stops us from feeling that way now, just as we would in time? It is our choice to live in ignorance of facts; facts we know but refuse to entertain.",musings
"Indebted","We often take much for granted, immersing ourselves in ego, mistakenly believing we are the pinnacle of existence. In this chain of life, we focus primarily on the present and future, neglecting to duly acknowledge the past.
 
 By ""past,"" I refer not to my own history, but to the generations that came before me. This realization struck me while teaching my granddaughter our mother tongue, Konkani. 
 I pondered the ancestors who labored to assign meaning to the sounds we now call language and the numerous generations it must have taken for their efforts to be well-received and understood.
 
 I feel compelled to appreciate these endeavors and recognize that I am not solely a product of my own making, as I once believed. Therefore, I amend my belief: I owe a great deal to past generations and am indeed indebted to them.","family, musings"
"November","November, a name that may vary in other languages, evokes a sense of festivity for me. Perhaps it is due to our chapel feast of the Lord Redeemer. I recall eagerly counting down the days a month in advance.
 
 My route to school would shift to Golthechan, as I anticipated the first signs of festivity: the commencement of earth digging to install wooden poles for the shamiana. I remember the excitement of sharing this news with others. The following ten days would fly by, altering my routine. Indeed, it was the only time I'd leave a football game early without remorse, and so would my peers.
 
 The hot water bath from the Bhand, the aroma of straw that accompanied gushing water, my attire, and my spirited walk towards the chapel were all highlights. The petromax's filtered light illuminated the trees at varying degrees as I approached my destination. The choir's harmonious sound and the tempting smell of bhajjas mingled with naphthalene balls, indicating the presence of clothes that had been stored for almost a year. Despite struggling to fit into one-year-old shoes, the thrill of being there made it worthwhile.
 
 However, this November feels different. The pandemic has taken its toll; people have surrendered to self-invited gloom. The village appears in mourning, lamenting its first fatality‚ once just a statistic but now a personal tragedy.
 
 As someone who believes life is meant to be lived fully, not merely survived, I am eager to bring back festivity. With necessary precautions in place, on November 15th, I will attend the Redemptor Saibachem Fest at Armacar Niwas.","memories, musings"
"The Paradox of Nothingness","Life begins with nothing and appears to end with everything, which ultimately means nothing. In life, everything is nothing, and nothing is everything. Our journey is false if based solely on objectivity. The only true presence in your life is absolute consciousness, not dependency. This blissful state of mind is the ultimate goal, or in worldly terms, heaven. Here, it is acknowledged that even nothing holds value through detachment.
 
 The value of 10 is hidden within the numbers 0 to 10, yet we begin counting at 1. This oversight in our education suggests that everything starts from something, which is incorrect; it starts from nothing which is something. Be reminded that zero's value depends on which side its placed.
 
 Theistic religions emphasize objectivity, enticing followers with the prospect of holding onto or being rewarded with these objects after life's end. This notion is misguided.
 
 At a human level, we engage in this deception but should recognize that detachment is the key.",musings
"Highs and Lows","Cherish Life
 A sudden urge to appreciate life, often overlooked, arises within me.
 It's clear that life is a pendulum,
 Swinging between highs and lows.
 Nothing endures eternally, neither peaks nor valleys,
 Yet the valleys weigh heavier than the elation of peaks.
 
 To truly cherish life, we must embrace the highs doubly so, counterbalancing the lows ahead.
 Today is such a day for me,
 And I'm wholeheartedly reveling in its amplified joys.

"Unity Amidst Crisis","22nd March 2020
 This day was truly exceptional.
 The dawn was unusually quiet, devoid of mechanical noise.
 Nature took control.
 The sky was clearer, and the crescent moon seemed to smile, as if saying, ""Now you know.""
 The poor felt rich as wealth lost its meaning.
 
 Indeed, humans quarantined themselves to combat the coronavirus.
 
 Neighbors united while staying apart,
 The Gods cooperated, absolving the faithful from rituals.
 
 This effort, dubbed Janata Curfew,
 Was not enforced but voluntarily observed for humanity's sake.
 
 It was a national call,
 India uniting without religion, caste, or political ideology.
 
 This intrigues me.
 Why are we divided during prosperity,
 Yet united in crisis?
 As humans, we desire a happy life,
 And that is what truly matters.
 We should not need a virus to awaken us.
 Perhaps this lesson, learned the hard way,
 Promises better days ahead.",musings
"Embracing Seniority","Lately, I've received comforting words about being a senior citizen. While it has its merits, I refuse to deny my aging reality.
 
 As a senior, I embrace unbounded freedom, akin to a vagabond. Busyness no longer defines my worth, and I've freed myself from most responsibilities without guilt. At times, I relish the solitude of silence.
 
 I've savored the sweet and sour experiences of youth. Reflecting on a song lyric that resonates with me: If there was a well of youth, I wouldn't take a sip, and that's the truth.
 
 Feeling content with fulfilling my duties well, I recall moments once aspired for in the future. Realizing that the desired future is now, I don't plan to halt my journey but will pause to appreciate my accomplishments. 
 
 With humility and no regrets, I stand ready to pack my bags for the next to come.","musings, memories"
"Rediscovering Youthful Joy","Ah, the Joys of Youth
 
 Few would contest the notion that youth is a delightful period in one's life. This is primarily due to the unburdened and autonomous nature of a young mind. However, as we age, our minds become trained in seriousness, replacing innocence with contemplation.
 
 In this state, vulnerability emerges, making one susceptible to radical influences. Individuals may feel compelled to join a particular group or adopt specific beliefs. Concepts such as God are propagated by the educated, leading to the identification of others by race or religion. Consequently, segregation takes root and an unspoken assertion arises: ""My God is superior to yours."" (here I must mention that education without secular mindset is ignorance.)
 
 This mindset fosters hypocrisy, ultimately resulting in the belief that life is a struggle.
 
 To rediscover the joy and playfulness of youth, cleanse your mind and resist indoctrination. Begin anew, without opinions or judgments from the past. Give it a try – you may not be able to articulate the difference, but you will certainly experience it. 
 Stay young.",musings
"Make your world smaller","Social media can be blamed for much of the restlessness in today's society. The term ""like-minded"" has become increasingly relevant, though one may wish it had remained a simple concept. Many individuals connect on social media platforms, claiming to be like-minded.
 
 If you find yourself on such a platform, it is wise to carefully filter content that does not align with your preferences. Alternatively, consider scantily using Facebook and Twitter, where opinions are often met with contention.
 
 For the sake of peace, make your world a little smaller. We were never designed to know every global event. If you find yourself addicted to social media, try satisfying the craving with a cigarette instead.",musings
"Between Zero and One","Society craves immediacy,
 Demanding swift conclusions.
 Fixated on binaries,
 Good or bad, happy or sad,
 Healthy or sick, pass or fail,
 Truth or lie.
 Yes or No.
 Such judgments lack distinction.
 
 We count one, two, three,
 Yet serenity lies between.
 Value resides between zero and one.
 
 Not telling the truth isn't lying

"Discovering Bliss","1) Self-imposed isolation leads to unintended consequences
 2) Absence of gratitude
 3) Masquerading self-pity as victimhood
 4) Incentivized appreciation
 5) Relying too heavily on blessings, ignoring self role
 6) Denying the possibility of being the problem
 
 Cultivate habits to prevent these behaviors and discover bliss.",musings
"Early Memories","With time on my hands, I decided to revisit my earliest memory. What an experience it was – almost like a fantasy at play, with flashbacks aplenty. It's challenging to pinpoint if it was indeed the earliest memory.
 
 Give it a try, and you'll realize the delightful company you are to yourself.","memories, musings"
"Opinions, Knowledge, and Clarity","Opinion: A view or judgment on something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge. The intriguing part is that it's not always grounded in facts or knowledge. Pause for a moment and consider how opinionated you are, and how much it governs your thought process. How much of it is truly based on facts or knowledge? For myself, I find the answer to be less than fifty percent. So why should such notions dominate most of my life?
 
 I've resolved to refrain from being overly opinionated and to seek facts and knowledge before accepting a statement as true. This endeavor has cleared much clutter from my mental storage, invigorating my pursuit of knowledge. It has bolstered my confidence in admitting, ""I don't know."" Furthermore, it has reinforced my belief that knowing you don't know is the essence of knowledge.
 
 Many a time, opinion had deceived me into thinking it was knowledge.",musings
"School","I awoke as usual, yet something felt different. I noticed the birds chirping and could discern at least nine distinct melodies. This experience transported me back to my school days.
 
 The morning rituals: grabbing my bag, walking the muddy road, feeling the mist in the air and the dampness on the weeds. The sound of the bell, and the hurried final steps to arrive on time for assembly. The punctuality of the first few days, with tidy books and completed homework, gave me a sense of pride that I had grown since the previous year – even if it only lasted a few weeks.
 
 Singing ""Happy Birthday"" for a classmate, anticipating an extra share of sweets as their best friend. Attempting to impress girls in hopes of future courtship. All these memories seem so wonderful, yet I still longed for holidays back then. Now I wonder why – yes, I truly miss my school days.","memories, musings"
"Life's Progress","Life: a work in progress,
 Indeed, progress.
 Enhance your life and those around,
 Release unwanted baggage.
 
 Sacrifice your ego's claim, ""I am right,""
 Such attitudes aren't progress, but regression.
 Clinging to unwanted baggage too long turns it to garbage,
 And then, you simply stink.",musings
"Names","What's your name? This question seems to appear less frequently as we age. Do you remember when young the pride in answering this query, chest puffed out, declaring your name?
 
 As we grow older, it may feel rude to ask someone their name directly. Instead, we opt for the more polite, ""May I know your good name?"" But why the change?
 
 It's quite simple: one expects to be recognized. ""Don't you know me?"" If not, it's your responsibility to humbly inquire.
 
 This isn't merely about names or identity; it's about who we are beyond our monikers. Consider this: who would you be without a name? It's a perplexing thought.
 
 You might realize that you'd still be yourself but without identification. Thus, the importance of our names becomes clear.
 
 However, as time passes, our names alone may feel insufficient. We begin to focus on prefix and suffix such as qualifications, achievements, wealth, and so forth. We expect recognition through these additions rather than just our names.
 
 This mindset warrants reconsideration. Remember that the most beautiful sound one is attracted to is their name. Forget the prefixes /suffixes and strive to be worthy of being directly asked or called by your name.",musings
"Confronting Mortality","Life: A Reflection
 
 It is my aim to help alleviate the fear of death, a challenging endeavor. Life permeates everything, and to believe otherwise is foolish. This is the doctrine we've become accustomed to.
 
 I remain unconvinced, not confused, but rather baffled that others fail to grasp the reality that all living things must eventually fade away. While I don't advocate embracing death, it's perplexing how some insist on the notion of eternal life. How naive can we be?
 
 If only we could accept the value of life lies in its finiteness, how much more meaningful would our existence be? It merely requires a shift in perspective, at no cost, but with the courage to face the truth. As they say, practice makes perfect; embrace this thought and find bliss. 
 Death is a gift of LIFE .",musings
"On Envy","Refrain from fantasizing about others,
 For it breeds envy and tarnishes the admirer.
 Do not claim it is human nature to feel so,
 But rather acknowledge you feel this way because you are human.
 
 As humans, we possess options, yet often neglect to explore them.
 Embrace reality as it is and become an engaged participant.
 
 Cherish the treasure of your time,
 Utilize it wisely and strive to be true to yourself.
 Avoid the pretense of goodness, for it may harbor deceit.
 If being you is inherently good, then that is your character.
 
 To fantasize about another's life is only to depreciate your own.",musings
"Who am I?","Thought for Today:
 
 Ask yourself, ""Who am I?"" 
 As you strive to understand yourself,
 Competing with others loses meaning.
 Your focus becomes solely on being you.
 
 The challenge lies in self-discovery,
 For we're often shrouded in falsehood.
 Yet, beneath the layers, you exist,
 Unburdened by accolades and attachments,
 Free of anxiety and at peace within.
 
 Spend time with yourself; it's worthwhile.",musings
"Minimalism and Ambition","The word ""more"" has become so fashionable that it nearly ridicules the concept of minimalism. With its unquenchable nature, one might question whether aspiring for more is a misguided pursuit. While I ponder this, I must admit that my answer may not be entirely conclusive.
 
 There is nothing inherently wrong with seeking more, provided that one keeps in mind the value of minimalism. Striking a balance between ambition and simplicity helps maintain one's identity and sanity. Solely chasing after more by aping without appetite can lead to greed, potentially sabotaging one's peace of mind.
 
 Minimalism need not imply scarcity; rather, it represents the precise amount needed for genuine contentment. Anything beyond that often serves as a means of seeking approval from society. This competitive mindset, focused on comparing oneself to others rather than personal growth, can result in restlessness.
 
 Let us give minimalism its due credit. After all, being a minimalist doesn't mean owning nothing; it means ensures that nothing owns you.",musings
"Contemplating Life's End","Often, I contemplate what I would do if I knew the end was near. What would sustain me until that inevitable moment? Initially, the thought was quite unnerving. However, with time and reflection, it became more manageable.
 
 Perhaps I would reconcile my past, a journey known only to myself. While many have contributed to it, life is ultimately one's own experience. Should I find myself facing the end, I am confident in relying on my memories to see me through. The memories with the comfort of being honest.
 
 The greatest joy I can draw is the fortune of having been born. At sixty-two, it feels as if this is just the beginning – the start of the unknown. The only certainty is that it will eventually come to an end.","musings, memories"
"Detachment","Many individuals fall into the trap of believing their belongings define them, subsequently identifying themselves as part of their possessions. This mindset gives rise to an identity crisis simply because once wealth is drained you also lose your character proportionately.
 
 So, who are you? Do riches make you who you are, or do you create your wealth? The answer is quite simple. If you are attached to material items, they shape your identity; conversely, if you are detached, it is you who creates your wealth. Who you are matters more then what you are.
 Detachment fosters a sense of sanity",musings
"The Blank Canvas","Blank ‚Äì a word that often elicits aversion, as it signifies emptiness. Yet, paradoxically, emptiness can hold more meaning than one might initially assume. Our inclination toward materialism has led us to fear the concept of emptiness.
 
 To foster creativity, humanity must learn the art of unlearning. Discarding redundant information allows us to start anew with fresh perspectives. In our ever-evolving world, mastering the skill of blanking one's mind and gaze is crucial.
 
 Embrace the blank, for it is within this emptiness that the sought-after Eureka moments arise. Empty the trash, and discover the attraction of being blank.",musings
"Moments","I recently watched a Charlie Chaplin film from 1914, which was undoubtedly amusing. Upon realizing it has been 107 years, I felt a sense of emptiness knowing none of the characters are still alive. This led me to ponder: did they ever imagine someone would find entertainment in their work after over a century? It seems unlikely.
 
 In today's context, with widespread insecurity due to the pandemic, our only option is to exercise caution and accept that we each traverse this path just once before becoming history. So, relax! It is merely a cycle - if not now, then later, we will all depart.
 
 Until then, let us relish the journey and remember it is a gift, not an entitlement. Every journey is best appreciated in moments; take pleasure in your presence at this very instant.","musings, memories"
"Anger","Getting angry seldom solves an issue; rather, it tends to worsen it. A calm mind is crucial for addressing life's challenges.
 
 Consider these practices:
 1. Be mindful of others' emotions and avoid causing harm.
 2. Remember it takes two to create misunderstanding contemplate your actions leading to the issue and devise ways to make amends.
 3. Swift solutions require effort; evading problems or shirking responsibility won't help, as true resolutions stem from within. 
 4. Prioritize significant tasks over pressing ones when strategizing.
 5. A relaxed mindset aids in navigating life's obstacles.
 6. Embrace happiness, as it not only affects your mood but also positively impacts those around you. Contentment flourishes when we observe happiness radiating onto others due to our conduct – that is what truly matters in life.",musings
"A Foot's Perspective","I glanced at my feet,
 Wondering if they were truly mine.
 They seemed defiant, as if unwilling to admit they belonged to me.
 A quiet inquiry arose: do you have time for us?
 
 Their complaint was evident,
 For they are last in line.
 Lacking the pampering of your face,
 Would you notice your shortcomings if we ceased our duties?
 
 We carry you without complaint,
 Bleeding for no fault of our own.
 Tired at times, yet we ensure you reach your destination.
 
 The lesson is clear:
 Take time to notice yourself - the whole you.
 Embrace your body,
 Thank every part for their service.
 You'll find no reason to complain,
 And begin to love yourself,
 Starting with your feet.",musings
"Heaven","While I don't dispute humanity's concept of heaven, my pursuit is to convince myself. Each time I question its existence, I'm compelled to explain the cosmos and its creator. If not a divine being in heaven, then who?
 
 I find myself cornered, lacking a persuasive explanation. However, I reassure myself that ignorance doesn't grant others the right to peddle myths. I believe time will eventually unveil the truth, as it has for many mysteries unknown to previous generations but understood today.",musings
"Remembering Joe","This morning is unlike any other, as the date November 15th, 2022 will forever remain etched in our memories. Our cherished brother Joe has passed away. While we mourn, we also rejoice in the fact that he was born and became an integral part of our lives.
 
 We were honored to have him as our leader. Despite occasional disagreements, mutual respect always prevailed – a virtue instilled in us by our parents, who taught us to respect our elders. Joe was the eldest among us, and his absence leaves a void difficult to fill.
 
 Nevertheless, we shall persevere and uphold the pride of declaring that ""We are Ten."" Although our ranks have begun to dwindle, forcing us to say ""We were Ten,"" the number ten will endure until the end.","family, memories, musings"
"Relationships","For a thriving, contented relationship, it's crucial to accept the unvarnished truth. Often, we hear that relationships involve compromise and give-and-take, but rarely are we told how much to give or take in order to maintain a successful partnership.
 
 The notion of give-and-take trying to maintain balance can be misguided. A healthy relationship involves agreeing to disagree, while setting boundaries that respect one another's feelings even if full agreement isn't reached. This approach safeguards one's identity, as excessive compromise can erode self-respect and ultimately lead to the dissolution of the relationship.
 
 For a robust relationship, open-mindedness is essential. Recognizing what is right should take precedence over who is right.
 A relationship built solely on compromise lacks genuine connection.
 Remember you have one life. Make it worthwhile.",musings
"Life's Brief Wisdom","Why the haste for tomorrow,
 When today has yet to conclude?
 Still, we lament,
 Life is brief.
 
 Regardless of our presence, tomorrow approaches.
 Today offers ample time if one observes their surroundings.
 A recent encounter sparked this reflection:
 A middle-aged man sat alone, striking stones together, delighting in their resonance.
 
 I hesitate to label him a beggar,
 For who am I to categorize others?
 If I must assign a title,
 Let it be ""teacher,""
 For he imparted wisdom upon me.

"Wealth vs. Freedom","The Paradox of Plentifulness: A Billionaire's Thoughts
 
 Delving into a billionaire's mind, I contemplate what they possess that eludes me. I value my freedom to roam the streets and having adequate means for a comfortable existence.
 
 For billionaires, privacy and independence are relinquished; security constantly surrounds them. Vigilance is crucial in their daily lives, preventing leisurely interactions with street vendors or enjoying simple delights in public spaces.
 
 Their vast wealth often benefits others more than themselves. Society admires billionaires for lavish items like timepieces valued tens of thousands above ordinary ones, although both display the same hour. This raises questions about society's wealth obsession and to what extent it truly belongs to an individual.
 
 I respect the billionaire for their sacrifices, which are often misinterpreted .
 Upon reflecting on their journey to attain such status, one realizes the selflessness they embody, as ultimately, they share their achievements with others – willingly or not.",musings
"Destiny","Destiny, as explained, refers to events beyond our control. I find solace in this concept, as it allows me to outsource my anxiety to the power of randomness, believing that I am not entirely in control of any outcome, even if it means a 0.1% chance of an unexpected result.
 
 Often, I have passionately defended this notion against friends who argue that our destiny lies in our own hands. Their perspective may seem sensible when they suggest that we must put forth effort to shape our desired destination; otherwise, it is akin to leaping into the sea without learning to swim. It can be challenging to counter such observations without falling into their trap.
 
 However, I maintain that destiny does not equate to irrational beliefs. In fact, acknowledging destiny enables one to prepare thoroughly for any foreseeable eventuality while simultaneously accepting that unforeseen circumstances may occur.
 Ultimately I am convinced that my being is determined by time. How long, no one knows.","musings, random"
"Shifting Perceptions","It can be rather amusing to observe one's shift in perception about a person or an organization. At times, the change of feelings can be quite dramatic, transforming someone from an angel to a devil. In such instances, a conscious mind might wonder why such a shift occurs.
 
 This phenomenon demonstrates the biased nature of humans. We often draw conclusions without proper diligence and believe ourselves to be correct. We propagate our beliefs to others as if they were gospel truth, almost to the point of no return. However, when our expectations are not met by that person or group, we become frustrated and alter our perception in the opposite direction. In doing so, we paint the entire canvas without realizing that merit may exist in some actions of the once-adored individual.
 
 When cornered, we activate bias and defend the indefensible. In such cases, it is crucial to amend our belief system and understand that every person possesses their own mindset. Their actions may not always meet our expectations, but before passing judgment, we should avoid bias and let merit prevail. As the saying goes, give the devil its due.",musings
"Guilt: A Prison","Prison: upon hearing this word, one often envisions crime, barbed wire, and towering walls – all symbols of restricted freedom. Prisons are commonly associated with punishment meted out by authorities for proven wrongdoing. Yet, if a crime remains unproven, are we truly innocent?
 
 According to the law, we are – and justifiably so. However, at this point, we may imprison our own conscience by telling a lie and subsequently experiencing guilt. Nature possesses its own methods; it does not rely on external prisons but rather imprisons us within ourselves. To savor genuine freedom, live by your conscience.",musings
"Honesty and Truth","Honesty extends beyond merely telling the truth; it also encompasses refraining from telling a lie . While these terms bear a resemblance, they differ significantly. One can be honest without necessarily revealing the whole truth.
 
 Truth may not always warrant disclosure, but lying burdens one for a lifetime,
 Honesty allows us to accept our imperfections. Circumstances may compel us to withhold truth, yet if it holds value, it shall ultimately triumph.
 
 Be honest to oneself.",musings
"Aging and Acceptance","Age, often considered a simple number, conceals its true influence on our abilities. Tasks manageable at 20 may become challenging at 60. We must acknowledge that age carries implications beyond mere digits.
 
 Growing older bestows wisdom and acceptance of age-related limitations. As more yesterdays accumulate than tomorrows, an unavoidable slowdown emerges.
 
 Our minds maintain youthful vigor while our bodies bear life's journey's marks. Nostalgia shades our perceptions, as diminishing physical capacities influence our view of the past.
 
 Embracing aging without regret is essential, but recognizing its changes is equally crucial, 
 Age is a just a number – but be mindful that as this number adds the balance reduces.
 Enjoy life in a hurry. Celebrate your birth everyday and don't wait for the one day per year.
  
 For comfort answer this: How old would you be if you didn't know the day you were born?","musings, memories"
"Panjim: Reflecting on 50 Years","At the age of thirteen, Panjim became a part of my life due to monthly visits to Goa Medical College for treatment of Rheumatoid arthritis. This continued for a few years until I stopped the treatments. One injection was particularly painful due to the non-micro needles used back then. Consequently, Panjim wasn't associated with pleasant experiences.
 
 In May 1972, I stayed in Panjim for twelve days, not on a vacation but in a hospital prior to follow-up treatments. Thus, I can safely share my observations of Panjim over the last fifty years.
 
 My daily trips to Panjim began in 1975 after failing tenth grade (a story for another time). With time on my hands, I traveled via launch service from Diwar (Gazolin) to Panjim Navigation Department.
 Back then, Panjim still had a colonial atmosphere. The Portuguese word for officer, ""empregado,"" was frequently heard, and siesta was observed by closing shops and offices between one and three in the afternoon. People leisurely enjoyed lunch and ""cerveja"" (beer) was popular.
 
 Commercial Panjim centered around St. Tome square, also known as Tobacco square, where our small shop, L.A. Armacar, was located. Most dwellings were two stories high with tile rooftops. Hotel Mandovi and later Tourist Hostel were prominent buildings. Cars were few; ""Ponte de Linhares,"" the bridge, was the entry and exit route to the city with a stop-and-go sign operated by the police.
 Restaurants served Goan food without Chinese or Mughlai influences; Udupi cuisine marked the first culinary change.
 
 Now, fifty years later and back in St. Tome, memories flood in as I count the merchants (known as ""negociante"" back then) and recall their business practices. Most establishments have closed or changed, supporting the idea that businesses have a lifespan of about forty years unless they adapt.
 
 Emotions stir within me as I accept that the square has retained its architecture but its soul and the surroundings have changed. I console myself that fifty years have changed me as well.","memories, musings"
"Body and Mind","We often mention the need to control our bodies, which may be true, but sometimes the mind enters overdrive when it realizes the body isn't meeting expectations - we call this sickness. At this point, we must train our minds not to think of extreme solutions, but instead allow our bodies the opportunity to activate all available options to return us to the right course.
 
 It's important to acknowledge that our bodies have built-in remedies for everyday ailments that don't require specialist intervention. This is not to undermine medical professionals, whose value is truly appreciated when we are in distress. However, we must also recognize that medicine is a profession, and like all professions, it involves financial considerations.
 
 The existence of more hospitals doesn't necessarily mean fewer patients; rather, for medical professionals to thrive, they must not only cure existing patients but also create new ones.",musings
"Perfection","Perfection is a pursuit and will remain so, though many of us strive to attain it in our endeavors. Keep in mind that perfection is a relative phenomenon, not an absolute one.
 
 One may satisfy their urge by deeming the outcome perfect, which is relative to one's feelings, but nothing can be absolutely perfect. It is rightly said that perfection is boring, as it halts progress, and life is essentially a work in progress.
 
 Let perfection be your pursuit, and progress will follow.",musings
"Reflecting on Pascu's Milestone","As my youngest sibling Pascu (Anand) approaches his half-century milestone, I can't help but reflect on a similar, albeit different, moment in my own life. Forty-seven years ago, while in ninth grade, my young mind grappled with life's challenges and the overwhelming anxiety of uncertainty. To comfort myself, I reminded myself that nothing is permanent and things would change.
 
 I then daydreamed about the day Pascu would complete his fiftieth year. I pictured how we would look, where we would be, and what our status might be, hoping we'd all be achievers in our own right. Most importantly, I wondered if I would remember this moment.
 
 Today, as that day approaches, I'm humbled and ecstatic to realize my wish of us being achivers has come true. Though I wish all ten of us could gather to commemorate this event – sitting in silence, reminiscing about the past with gratitude for our wonderful journey thus far, the pandemic has made this impossible.
 
 Nevertheless, this red-letter day fills me with overwhelming emotion and a desire to celebrate it:
 
 Cheers to the day!
 
 Happy Birthday Pascoal Anand Hermigildo de Delfino Pereira
 
 Stay young and blessed, brother.","family, memories, musings"
"Grandfather's Joy: Maya's Impact","Xapai,
 The title I opted for; instead of grandpa 
 Now sounds even sweeter when my granddaughter Maya
 Calls me by it.
 Sixty one years to earn this title,
 Probably nature, in its wisdom, chose the perfect moment.
 
 I feel truly blessed by my granddaughter, for she has invigorated my life.
 It is often said that to feel different, one must awaken the child within. This is precisely what occurs each time Maya is with me; the child inside me stirs. However, I also envision her journey through a long life ahead. Intelligent and already conscious of her appearance, she desires to be well-groomed and often affirms her own beauty.
 
 I know she will perceive life differently than I did, as her future lies in an advanced world. My hope is that she adheres to worthy values, and perhaps some parts from my writing will aid her in achieving this.","family, musings"
"May the soul rest in peace","This phrase, often employed to console, seems to be on autopilot these days. We must thank whoever initiated this comforting expression, as it has undoubtedly simplified our lives. Yet, having used it countless times, I find myself questioning its meaning and my authority to wish such a thing for the deceased.
 
 What is the soul? My search began with the dictionary, which defines it as the spiritual and immaterial part of a human being, regarded as immortal. This immortality implies that the soul is endless. Thus, another question arises: what does peace mean for something infinite?
 
 In our world, we experience peace when we recognize and overcome its opposites – violence, chaos, unrest, confusion, etc. Therefore, peace cannot be endless. Since the soul is immortal, it seemingly disqualifies from experiencing eternal peace. So I decided to abandon the phrase altogether.
 
 This realization led me to ponder why we feel anguish over death. Ultimately, death signifies the end of everything for the deceased; we have no authority to wish them anything but to remember their deeds fondly if they inspire positive feelings.
 
 However, we tend not to practice this because our emotions focus on what we lose when someone dies and what we may miss after our own demise. Thus, it has more to do with ourselves than the departed.
 
 Rather than wishing for souls to rest in peace after death, perhaps it is more fitting to ask ourselves: how content is my soul while I am alive and well?",musings
"Frustration: A Common Dilemma","We all construct our ideal worlds, influenced by our expectations and desires. Often, we attempt to enforce these ideals on others to achieve our goals. However, when met with opposition, frustration arises, casting a gloomy outlook on the future. This is particularly common when the implementation of our ideals is dependent on others.
 
 It is essential to recognize that each of us has unique expectations aimed at improving our individual worlds. We take ownership of ""our world"" but it has to be ""my way"". This attitude proves to be impractical. At this point its crucial to recognise that one can improve the situation on focusing on things within one's control.
 
 Accept that you are ultimately responsible for your happiness. If necessary, adjust your perception and focus on living life on your terms within a smaller scope. The world is beautiful ‚Äì don't squander your time indulging in frustration.",musings
"Marriage","Getting married is not an achievement; sustaining a marriage for a lifetime is, especially in today's environment. Admittedly, aligning two minds for a lifetime is no easy task. However, such an admission rarely comes to light before the marriage, as it is often portrayed as ""made in heaven."" To me, this notion seems illogical unless heaven is as good as marriage. Then, at times one might wonder where hell resides.
 
 Marriage is a worthy endeavor only if both parties accept that it comes with an unknown package and unforeseen challenges to overcome, bound by love rather than law. Respect for one another should supersede all else; with a respectful mindset, true love can flourish while mere infatuation fades. 
 
 Love at first sight moments do exist, but it is crucial to remember that sight is not constant.
  
 Despite conflicts there are lasting partnerships not because they are made in heaven but could be attributed to one or both partners being divinely crafted.
 
 A happy marriage is always a work in progress.","musings, family"
"Maria Antonia: A Life Journey","10th July 1928
 
 A first child was born to the proud couple, Simao Luis Gomes and Catarina Aguiar. They named her Maria Antonia Gomes.
 
 I imagine that day must have been filled with celebration. Simao likely called his friends and shared a drink of feni under a tree near his house in Maddant.
 
 Maria was a beautiful child. Unfortunately, she contracted chickenpox at a young age, a dreadful illness in those days. With devoted care from her parents and her uncle Manuel Aguiar, she prevailed. The disease left scars on her lovely face, but her beauty remained intact.
 
 Maria attended the local school, completing primary education. On 14th May 1949, at the age of 21, she married the handsome Luis Antonio Pereira. He was her neighbor but worked in Bombay. Their wedding took place at St. Xavier Church in Dabul.
 
 After their marriage, Luis Antonio relocated to Goa. In their 23 years together, they had eleven children. Tragically, their eldest child Indira passed away as an infant. The remaining ten children persevered; I am one of them.
 
 Our mother was a saint personified. By default, she inherited the name Aurora, which literally means ""the dawn."" A fitting tribute to this remarkable woman who once graced this planet.
 
 Happy Alor Day!","family, memories"
"Future and Fortune","When pondering parents' aspirations for their children's future and fortune, a clear conclusion remains elusive. From the moment a child is born, the notion of a secure future, accompanied by fortune, takes center stage. This phenomenon primarily affects middle-class families, causing them to lose sight of the true purpose of having a child.
 
 In focusing so intently on the future, parents often miss the present and their child's presence, leading to conditional love. This mindset essentially communicates, ""I will love you more if you meet my expectations."" Such an attitude confuses children, and its effects manifest when they become adults, with love becoming conditional in reverse.
 
 In pursuing fortune, we risk forfeiting our children's futures – futures they should shape themselves. It is crucial to remember that love ought to be unconditional. Cherish your child simply because they are your creation, but do not claim ownership of their future. The 'run fast, run far' attitude should change. We must remember that migration is a compromise one has to make due to circumstances pushing them or opportunities pulling them, but by no means is it a status symbol, which it is often mistaken to be. Guide them toward possibilities and recognize that having them close, both emotionally and geographically, is the true measure of fortune.","family, musings"
"My Father's Journey","Maka zai tench kortolom' - a phrase often uttered by my father, Luis Antonio, whose fiftieth death anniversary approaches on October 7, 2023. My dad lived life on his terms, as the Konkani phrase suggests. A self-made man, he passed away at forty-eight. I feel his life was like an incomplete journey, but I surrender to my belief that time is the ultimate ruler of our lives.
 
 Yet, I sometimes question my own approach to life. How much of it is truly on my terms, and how sacred should I hold that notion? My life isn't entirely on my terms, and rightly so. Terms need not be unyielding; they can bend for a better outcome. I wish my father had considered this option and listened to my mother, who passed away just over a year before him, leaving us ten children orphaned - a reality we've faced for fifty years come October 7, 2023.
 
 On this day, we plan to release a book detailing our experiences and journey thus far: 'The Armacars: Ten Siblings, One Story.'","family, memories, musings"
"Hanging Up on Gossip","Gossip is often referred to as the devil's telephone, and it's best to hang up. However, this is easier said than done. Gossip has been a part of human existence for ages, and life might seem dull without it. I admit that I have indulged in gossip from time to time, but I've tried hard to abstain.
 
 Although I can't claim complete success, knowing that I haven't gossiped provides a sense of satisfaction. Yet, one may unintentionally fall into the trap of adding value to a conversation that amounts to gossip. This typically occurs as a reflex action, without considering the potential harm caused by such conversations.
 
 To avoid gossiping, I have devised a simple method: refrain from discussing others in their absence, whether positively or negatively. If someone else brings up the topic, merely acknowledge the good aspects. Give this method a try; it may prove helpful.",musings
"Envy: A Silent Killer","Often perceived as harmless, envy is, in fact, a silent killer. As the saying goes, envy corrodes the vessel that holds it. Many of us misunderstand envy, believing it to be discontent with oneself for not possessing what others have - wealth, fame, beauty, and so forth.
 
 However, I cannot fully agree with this definition. How else can we explain the envy one billionaire has for another, one actor for their peer, or one beauty pageant contestant for their competitor? These individuals seemingly possess the same qualities, yet envy arises from their ignorance in truly knowing themselves. Instead, they rely on external validation.
 
 To prevent this corrosion of your own vessel, invest time in self-discovery. Once you recognize your true self, envy will naturally dissipate. Remember that another's success is not your failure.",musings
"Memories from Fifty Years Ago","Recalling feelings from fifty years ago is no easy task, yet some memories remain as vivid as if they occurred today. I distinctly remember being in the hospital (Goa Medical College, old building) on October 7th, 1973, when my father passed away. Today marks half a century since that fateful day, but one thing that eludes me is how I ended up there to be with my father. Despite my best efforts, I cannot recall a single instance leading up to that moment. This only reinforces the notion that I was not myself at the time.
 
 One memory that remains fresh is the sound of a knock on the door, which I desperately hoped would never come. With my father's condition precarious, a late-night knock seemed like an ominous confirmation of his passing. My father had instructed me to sleep at Uncle Ciriac's house since he felt better; our brother Joe and Joe Aguiar stayed with him. Although I left reluctantly, I dreaded that knock.
 
 When it came, I knew the outcome. Bravely accepting it, the child within me cried. The realization of ten of us being orphaned - with me being young at fourteen and six siblings behind me - was hard to believe.
 
 The echo of my cry resonates even now. I remember where I sat and the comforting hug of a young lady from Diwar, whose presence at such an early hour remains a mystery. She was the wife of a butcher named Mohamad and tried to console me with her tears falling onto my hand while uttering, ""Allah knows what's right.""
 
 Today, fifty years may have passed, but it feels like yesterday. In the same breath, I am astounded by our resilience, clearly displayed in what we have become today.
 
 This date has added yet another dimension to my life as I am celebrating my granddaughter Maya's birthday. Indeed, I am a proud Xapai. This is called destiny.","family, memories, musings"
"Hillman Husky: GDA 3894","Hillman Husky - that was our father's car back in the sixties, a hatchback. On the island of Diwar, there were few private cars - certainly less than five - so it was a luxury to own one, and we were part of that exclusive group.
 
 I remember the initial color: dark green base with a cream top, later changed to maroon bottom and cream top. In those days, cars usually had two shades. Rides in that car were scarce, mostly within the island. We would accompany our father on his bar trips, eagerly awaiting our share of Goldspot soft drinks served to us in the car. I can still recall the satisfying burp from that fizzy beverage.
 
 There were no air conditioners or music systems in cars back then; hand signals were the norm. The smell of petrol added charm, reminding us of the journey. However, it could be a curse for those prone to car sickness, like Prakash. Poor chap often had to be dropped halfway to Panjim, usually at Old Goa at a bar our father frequented. He was compensated with ice cream - albeit half-melted - but sometimes missed the fun of watching a movie.
 
 We have fond memories of that car. For me, another vivid memory is the sound of its engine at midnight on the night our father passed away. It had come to pick me up for the hospital visit; I recall the door noise and instantly knew it was our car.
 
 I wish we had kept it for posterity, but alas, it was not meant to be.","family, memories, musings"
"Feast of St. Francis Xavier","As November approaches, the island of Diwar buzzes with anticipation for the novenas of St. Francis Xavier's Feast. In the 1970s, we would walk to the ferry, which connected us to a wonderland.
 
 Back then, Goa was primarily inhabited by Goans, so the fair was mostly run by Goans with a few visitors selling religious items. We even had our own restaurant, POP INN, a fitting name for young entrepreneurs seeking enjoyment and profit. Our friends frequented the establishment, providing business and lending a helping hand just for the fun of it.
 
 I remember the quote painted on the wall saying: ""IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO, THEN PLEASE DON'T DO IT HERE"" - a bold reminder to our friends to be productive.
 
 The highlight for me was the vespers night when less privileged individuals gathered to spend the evening with their local drum (ghumot), singing songs and attending the cross ladainha. A swig of local brew madachi feni kept spirits high. At dawn, they attended the feast day mass before making way for well-dressed attendees of the high mass.
 
 A notable feature of vespers night was matchmaking expeditions. Young girls from that community dressed elegantly, their faces displaying shy anticipation of a brighter future, while their parents eagerly attempted to arrange marriages.
 
 Nowadays, mobile phones have intruded upon this tradition. Nevertheless, I still attend vespers night in an effort to relive those cherished memories.","memories, musings"
"My First School","Attempting to recall my first day at school yields little success, yet I do remember one of my initial days. My school, a Marathi medium establishment, was situated within a temple around 1965. The only supplies required were a slate, known as 'paty,' and a chalk pencil called 'kadi.'
 
 Kindergarten, or 'opri' in Marathi, was one among five classes sharing one hall and one teacher - a recipe for chaos. Each class rhythmically recited lessons or tables, taking turns copying from the board based on the teacher's discretion.
 
 During that time, education was primarily between students and teachers; parents played minimal roles. There were no parent-teacher meetings, and educators were free to discipline students as they saw fit - occasionally causing pain.
 
 After studying in Marathi until third grade, I transitioned to an English medium school, repeating the third grade and losing an academic year. Comparing today's schooling with our past experiences reveals stark contrasts. While I cannot dispute the quality of modern education, our era's schooling undoubtedly fostered resilience for facing the future.","memories, musings"
"Ism: Power of Now","In stagnant times, when dullness seems to prevail, give yourself a chance and embrace 'ism' - a term I've coined for 'now, the present.' By this, I mean to set aside the past and future, as most of our worries stem from them. Believe in the power of now, as it exists in every fraction of a second.
 
 Acknowledge that you are here despite the so-called impediments one might envisage, and embrace that this is all that matters.
 
 Master living in the present, and your day will pass without grievances.
 Do not anticipate seeing the hour hand of a watch move; you will be disappointed. However, rest assured that it does complete a 360-degree rotation each day.",musings
"Why I Think the Way I Think","Undeniably, we are products of our society. The information we gather stems from what we hear, observe, read, or experience, resulting in a two-way flow. But is it possible to make this flow one-directional?
 
 This process aims to understand oneself from within, delving deep into the abstract. Although seemingly intangible, its presence is undeniable. This thought process represents an alternate way of thinking, best practiced in isolation rather than as a daily routine.
 
 It provides solace during distress – the very distress that arises from being part of society. Yet, we cannot escape our societal roles.
 
 A quote comes to mind: ""I am not what happened to me; I am what I choose to become.""",musings
"Rikshaw and Eighteen Passengers","Eighteen passengers in one rickshaw (tuk-tuk) sounds impossible, but this was one record set on my island of Diwar.
 
 As they say, necessity is the mother of invention. This necessity arose in the eighties, and we had to invent ways to commute. The three-kilometer ride from the mainland to the ferry point at Old Goa was a challenge. Ten of us squeezing together in one rickshaw was the norm, and each passenger knew their role. Newcomers were guided by regulars.
 
 What strikes me today is that it was a genderless society - one could push themselves onto anyone's lap or hold any part for those three kilometers. There were no rules as long as one reached the destination. A variety of smells mixed with sweat created an unacceptable concoction, but one had to get used to it.
 
 Not all passengers were saints; some looked forward to these rides for pleasures other than reaching their destination, often reciprocated. I used to opt for tempo rides, which were equally chaotic and suitable for pleasure - pun intended.
 
 I gave up rickshaw rides after standing in one - yes, we stood! We held onto roof rails for support while standing on either side of the driver's open cabin to maintain balance. During one such ride, my head hit a protruding canopy from a cart while maneuvering a zigzag. Fortunately, it was made of bamboo rather than metal; otherwise, it could have been tragic.
 
 This wild thought of writing these memories occurred when I noticed rickshaws no longer ply this route.""","memories, musings"
"Dingo Pereira","Who is Dingo? May his soul rest in peace. I generally avoid this phrase, but for Dingo, I'll make an exception.
 
 Our family, the Pereiras, can only trace our lineage to my father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. Our family tree appears rather linear before us - six brothers and four sisters. Regrettably, sisters cannot continue the Pereira name due to historical convention.
 
 Our father, Luis Antonio Pereira, was eager to learn about his ancestors. His grandfather had to abandon his birthplace because of some issues, I am told. Luis frequently visited his ancestral land, seeking connections to the Pereira family tree with no success.
 
 During a Bombay trip, he encountered a man named Dingo Pereira over drinks. Noticing their shared surname and location, Luis thought he had found a family link. He told this tale to his sister Isabel Cristalin D'Sa (Pereira by birth), who was delighted by the discovery. She confidently shared it with us whenever possible. Isabel survived our father by twenty-three years, even though she was ten years older.
 
 She always maintained her maiden surname as Pereira in all conversations. She wanted her coffin's name plaque to mention it, and I ensured it did. Her loyalty to that name was strong, so her excitement over finding a link to her ancestor was understandable. Although we suspected our father merely comforted her, we didn't contest her claim.
 
 Twenty-seven years after Isabel's death and fifty years after my father's demise, while paying homage on his golden death anniversary, we were examining old family portraits when an inquiry surfaced about Dingo's identity. It was then that I silently wished: whoever he may be, may his soul rest in peace.","family, memories, musings"
"Ferry Tales","Meet me at the 6 o'clock ferry' - such phrases were often heard during my college days. As islanders, Diwadkars had the luxury of meeting friends for a delightful, free fifteen-minute river cruise, where topics and plans were discussed since there was no other easier mode of communication.
 
 Recalling those days feels like a luxury I miss today. Although we still cross the ferry, the camaraderie has been lost due to the intrusion of mobile phones, resulting in an individualistic attitude on display. It may sound vague to call those fifteen minutes spent on the ferry with friends a stress buster, but it truly was. We would discuss various topics, or some would eagerly await meeting their prospective life partners. Worry would surround them if they missed that ferry since they had to wait until the next day to clear their anxiety.
 
 In those days, it was almost taboo to have a relationship before marriage, so the ferryboat ride served as a discreet meeting spot. A smile from two meters apart sufficed to keep the flame alive for the next day, eventually building long-term relationships.
 
 The best times were sometimes during bad moments for some commuters, such as when the ferry broke down. Back then, Diwar had only one ferry and repairs took hours, so an impromptu gathering was inevitable. It was more enjoyable in the evening on the Old Goa side as bars were within walking distance. Every hour added value as we listened to changes in tone and topics among revelers who occasionally burst into song. The happiest individuals were courting couples since no parents questioned their late arrival.
 
 Our ferryboat in those days not only ferried us to the other side but also set many on their lifelong journey together. So here's a thanks to that matchmaking machine.","memories, musings"
"Conquering Fear with Childhood Wisdom","I often reflect on my youthful experiences to navigate my present, particularly when faced with unwarranted anxieties. One of them is fear. Fear, as they say, is only as deep as you think. This adage seems perfect for warding off negative thoughts, yet fear can still linger.
 
 At this point, I remember my childhood adventures - simple acts like going fishing early morning, barefoot in the dark, amidst thick vegetation without worrying about snake bites or other calamities. It appears that fear didn't exist then because I was focused on reaching my destination in a timely manner. Thus, I practice a similar attitude to dispel fear by concentrating on my objectives and moving forward.
 
 When you're focused and passionate about reaching your goal, fear loses its grip. Ultimately, you'll realize there's no such thing as fear itself; it's merely the fear of fear that keeps you stagnant. Fear doesn't exist; it's created.","memories, musings"
"Spend on Sunny Days","Save for the Rainy Days
 
 Upon hearing this phrase, one might instinctively brace for difficult times ahead. However, I have learned the art of enjoying the rain.
 
 Why vilify rain, which is often associated with prosperity? Granted, the saying has become popular.
 While I'm not against saving, as it does give one a sense of stability, it shouldn't come at the expense of relishing a sunny day. We must remember that the present we are in was once envisaged as our future.
 
 It's worth noting that the concept of saving is a modern invention. In earlier times, there were no banks, stocks, or insurance - practically nothing. People were foragers and didn't even hoard food, yet they persevered.
 
 In contrast, many contemporary individuals are so preoccupied with saving that they opt to live miserly only to pass away wealthy. I frequently remind my friends that what you earn isn't truly yours, but what you spend is.
 
 So enjoy your sunny days and be wise enough to spend.
 Remember, it's one life, it's your life - make it worthwhile.",musings
"Tape Recorder","I remember the first time I heard a tape recorder; it must have been in the late sixties. Goa was still in its innocent stage, yet to be exposed to technology beyond the radio and gramophone.
 
 From early times, Goans migrated to other lands for better opportunities. Many went to Africa, the British colonies, or the Gulf. It was one of our neighbors, who had come on a break from Kuwait, who introduced us to this tape recorder. Our village was primarily agrarian with paddy as the main product. Before taking it to the mill, the paddy underwent boiling and drying processes.
 
 Drying was done at the neighbor's space. As casual conversations and mild gossip ensued, he started his recorder, and after some time played the recording. At about eight years old, I still remember the astonishment on everyone's faces, including mine.
 
 It was a miraculous experience for all, yet simultaneously embarrassing to listen to our out-of-rhythm voices and the unease of gossip being recorded.
 
 This moment spontaneously came back to me almost fifty-seven years later as I enjoyed music of my choice from a cellphone on a sophisticated music system.","memories, musings"
"Light of the world
 A Retreat","I am the light.
 
 Back then, every diocesan school's tenth standard students attended a retreat at Bom Jesus, Old Goa, conducted by Fr. George D'Sa. My batch was in 1975-76. The retreat, under the guise of the Light of the World movement, welcomed all faiths. Thus, my friend Ankush, a non-Catholic, and I, a casual Catholic practitioner, shared a room for one week.
 
 Our friendship began in ninth grade when he shifted schools. Although his second language was Marathi and mine French, I ended up attending Marathi classes in defiance due to my differences with the French teacher. Our friendship blossomed over our shared rebellious attitudes. Our discussions often revolved around questioning life's purpose and exploring vague subjects.
 
 Ankush's father owned a shop, so cigarettes were easily accessible. We'd sit on separate branches of a tamarind tree in my backyard and discuss various topics. However, we didn't realize that our philosophical pursuits wouldn't help us in exams. As expected, we both failed our tenth grade, and to this day, I feel guilty for swaying his bright mind.
 
 Returning to the retreat – as rebellious teenagers seeking answers and smoking in our room – one thing that influenced us was Jim Reeves' morning song ""One Day at a Time"" and Fr. George's serene disposition. He entered our smoky room one morning with a knowing smile but said nothing; we stopped smoking for the remainder of the retreat.
 
 On the penultimate day, an overwhelming candlelit oath-taking ceremony took place. I walked out feeling saintly but alas, it lasted no longer than a week. Nonetheless, I recognize the impact it had on me, though not permanent.","memories, musings"
Failure's Reward,"In particular, this pertains to my academic setbacks, as I don't believe in the idea of failure making one a loser. However, you do lose an academic year, and thus are held back. In my case, I lost two years – one in the tenth grade and another in the twelfth. During these years, I learned more than what I would have gained academically. I hadn't chosen to fail, but my rebellious nature led to a future influenced by random consequences.
 
 One reward emerged from my efforts, and it wasn't merely by chance. Having been delayed by two years, and as my college days lacked daily attendance since I had to work at my shop situated between the bus stand and the college, I had the opportunity to observe students commuting to college. While leaning on my shop's doorframe, I noticed a lively girl walking towards the college. Curious about her class and college affiliation, I visited the canteen and discovered she was in the thirteenth class, one year junior to me at our college. I got myself introduced through a common friend (Lizy) and came to know her name in the year 1981.
 
 At that moment, I felt grateful for having failed twice; otherwise, I might have missed her entirely. Though I felt I was punching above my weight, it didn't deter me.
 
 Thus began my pursuit. As an irregular college attendee, the best opportunity arose when I opted for a National Service Scheme (NSS) camp in 1982.
 
 Learning she would attend as an NSS volunteer, I eagerly enrolled. Confident in my ability to impress her, I shared my feelings with my friend Ivo at a bar (George Bar) near our meeting point before departure.
 
 My first plan of action was to identify potential rivals. Once we arrived at our destination, I decided to sponsor drinks for them to better understand their intentions. Eventually running out of money, I returned home to gather what little funds I could. Fortunately, Prakash secured a deal that provided me with 250 rupees.
 
 Eager to return before dusk and capitalize on my opportunity, my friend Stanley offered his Jawa bike, and off we went to Keri next to Doda Marg. Despite getting lost briefly, we made it back.
 
 Armed with money, I treated the other contenders one last time, making my intentions clear with a firm request for them to keep their distance. They obliged, and my path was clear. I'm grateful for my failures because that young girl is now a grandmother – yes, my wife.
 Today she turned a senior citizen.
 19/7/24
 A union of forty-two years. I am stopping short of saying ""I am what I am because of her"" only because I don't want to blame her.
 That being said, I don't know how to thank her.","family, memories, musings"
Seeking Answers in Adolescence,"The seventies marked an awakening in my life. As an adolescent, my curiosity peaked, and I sought the purpose of my existence. This period intensified due to circumstances beyond my control, driving me to find stability within and around me.
 
 This decade continued the hippie culture of the sixties. The saffron robes of Bhagwan Rajneesh's followers, later known as OSHO, were visible everywhere. My curiosity led me to explore Rajneesh's teachings while balancing practicality and fantasy. I knew that ultimately, I needed to focus on work and provide food for the table. However, this didn't deter me from learning about Rajneesh and his predominantly foreign following. I pondered why these seemingly wealthy individuals sought answers in India.
 
 I purchased some of his books from flea markets in Anjuna and later acquired cassettes when Walkmans became popular. Some of his quotes profoundly influenced my life and pursuit of self-understanding:
 - Darkness is merely the absence of light; light a candle, and you will see the light coming in but not the darkness going out.
 - To know you don't know is knowledge; not to know you don't know is ignorance. Knowledge isn't knowing everything but knowing that you don't know.
 - Don't worry about life after death; ensure you're living before death.
 - Don't be a follower; be a student. Followers obey instructions, while students discover the truth.
 
 These quotes, though perhaps not exact, provided me with a sense of comfort within myself and my surroundings.","memories, musings"
Bombay,"My first trip outside Goa was to Bombay, now Mumbai, in the late 70s. My uncle Cruz, visiting from Kuwait, invited me to join him and his family. Eagerly, I accepted. We traveled by bus, which back then lacked air conditioning and had rattling windows that made sleep elusive. The journey took around 14 hours due to the steep ghats.
 
 We arrived in Bombay early the next morning. The city's stench was overwhelming, a stark contrast to my village life. During my stay, I marveled at the Gothic architecture and enjoyed the less crowded atmosphere compared to today's bustling metropolis. However, I did not use the railways—a wise decision considering my inability to cope with such chaos.
 
 After a week, I boarded a steamer for my return journey. Unprepared, I brought only cigarettes and no bedding or blankets for the night. The daytime voyage was pleasant; passengers mingled and enjoyed camaraderie during our 24-hour journey. At night, I won one hundred rupees playing housie and treated myself to a beer.
 
 The cold night forced me to stay close to the engine room where I consumed most of my cigarette pack. As we approached Goa's coast from the Arabian Sea, the sight of pine trees evoked a sense of belonging. That memorable trip remains close to my heart.","family, memories, musings"
Presence,"Reading these reflections, one might think I'm stuck in the past, nostalgic for the 70s and 80s. But I live in the present, grateful for how my past shaped today. I focus on the now rather than dwelling on the future.
 
 So why do my most vivid memories come from thirty years ago? The last 35 years have brought many blessings: marriage, children, prosperity, and respect. Life has gotten better. Perhaps I was less conscious of my goals then; I moved through life more instinctively.
 
 My cherished memories come from times when I was truly present. Today, life moves so fast that we often miss the journey, fixating only on the destination. Once there, we immediately look to the next goal, never fully experiencing the moment. This might explain why those earlier years remain so clear in my memory.","memories, musings, family"
Barberias to Salons,"The term 'barberia' has evolved into 'salon,' and with it, the entire trade has transformed. Initially, barberias were masculine spaces, frequented solely by men for haircuts or shaves. They were monopolized by specific castes and passed down through generations, resulting in highly skilled craftsmen called 'malle' in Konkani.
 
 The atmosphere at a barber's shop was unique. Visiting the barber was not only for grooming services but also to catch up on village news. Barbers had a knack for securing their customers' agreement, perhaps due to the sharp razor or scissor sounds. Disagreements were rare; there was either silence or support for the barber's views.
 
 Today's salons differ greatly; they are unisex and offer a wider range of services with various hairstylists. Upon arrival, clients choose from different massages and treatments, while hairstylists often become salespeople promoting beauty products. One is careful not to disappoint them as one's future appearance lies in their hands.
 
 In contrast, at the barberia, one could simply request a haircut or shave without much fuss. Options were limited to military cuts or normal ones. Occasionally, one would be at the mercy of an apprentice. In such cases, you might hear the common term 'hampailo,' which referred to a botched haircut.
 
 These memories remain vivid as I recall being a victim of an apprentice myself.","memories, musings"
Diwar Summer Camps,"The excitement of May, with its promise of holidays for our children, always transports me back to my own younger days. Summer camp, as the eager youngsters called it, was a family gathering that brought together a diverse group of children, some as young as a few months old. Being ten siblings, not all married at the time, the camps had two phases, and in the first phase, our nieces and nephews eagerly anticipated these reunions.
 
 Somehow, I managed to fit everyone into my Gypsy, along with two bicycles and luggage. Once we arrived at the holiday home, the atmosphere was one of freedom and spontaneity. No particular schedule dictated meal or bath times, and activities like fishing expeditions or cricket games were filled with laughter and friendly arguments.
 
 A shared bathing experience at the well became a lottery system to determine the order. As the final days approached, pleas to the gods for an extended stay were common. I took on the role of divine mediator and granted their wishes, sending the youngest off to pray at nearby crosses. These moments allowed me to relive my youth while witnessing their joy.
 
 On their departure, some took a stone or leaf as a souvenir to preserve cherished memories. Now, all from the first phase have grown and some are scattered across the globe. I hope they still treasure those moments spent together.","family, memories, musings"
Equity vs Equality in Business,"Equitable and equal may sound similar, but there is a significant difference between the two, particularly in the realm of business. We often proclaim that everyone is equal when it comes to agreements or official documents. However, one must accept that equality does not always yield the desired outcome. It is equity that makes things work.
 
 In certain situations, strictly adhering to a document can hinder progress. For instance, it's akin to asking a chef not to taste their food for fear they might consume it. In the world of business, everything is negotiable unless it negatively impacts the system or diminishes value. Thus, it is crucial to embrace equity rather than solely focusing on equality.
 
 The famous legal maxim states: 'The law is equal for all men, but all men are not equal before the law.'",musings
Reflections on my Academic Journey,"From time to time, I find myself reminiscing about particular incidents, and I felt the urge to record one such memory. My academic journey from high school to earning two degrees was rather challenging, so much so that I nearly dropped out in the tenth grade. This wasn't due to a lack of intelligence, but rather a lack of enthusiasm and focus. Nonetheless, I carried on.
 
 One day, I resolved to reevaluate my life. I purchased a cigarette pack at the GMC canteen and sat in the nearby park, then known as the children's park. As the fresh air quickened my cigarette's burn, I pondered my future without pressure. This introspection brought to mind my father's hopes for me - to become a lawyer. It was a sudden realisation that put me back on course.
 
 Though unable to attend daily classes, I compensated by studying intensely in the college library a month before exams. This pattern persisted until I completed law school. The flashback inspiring this writing took place during my first year of law exams.
 
 Frequent library visits at law college familiarized me with college staff, whose casual demeanor influenced me during exams and made me overly relaxed. After completing all my papers, I awaited the results. To my dismay, the results indicated me , Absent and while the one ahead of me passed. I knew the surrounding benches were empty; therefore, it must have been me who occupied his seat.
 Proving this was difficult since all records showed he had answered.
 
 The only solution was obtaining a declaration from the actual absentee student and having it endorsed by the college. Thus, I tracked him down to his bank job in Bicholim. Upon asking about him, everyone shouted his name: ""Parsekar hanga yo!"" ; They were all aware of this mix-up.
 
 He kindly signed the declaration without hesitation and advised me to be cautious since things could have been worse.
 
 Since then, I've attempted not to be too casual in my endeavors – though admittedly, I am still only halfway there.","memories, musings, family"
"Ego: Vice, Virtue, or Balance?","Ego, in my opinion, is not the negative trait society often labels it as. It seems hypocritical to categorize it as a vice since everyone possesses this inherent characteristic. One might question why it is not considered a virtue instead. I believe this perception stems from the overrated value placed on humility. I must admit that excessive humility can border on arrogance.
 
 Ego rightfully has a place within our character, but moderation is crucial. An excess of ego may hinder our acceptance within society, as no individual can thrive in isolation. While ego can bolster confidence, it should not obstruct the merit of any discussion. The key lies in accepting what is right, not who is right.
 
 Contrary to popular belief, a person with ego is not devoid of ambition. When managed properly, ego serves as a catalyst for ambition. Therefore, I contend that ego is not the negative force it is often perceived to be.",musings
Nature's Indifference to Philanthropy,"Philanthropy, a distinctly human concept, seeks to benefit society. We frequently hear about climate change and experts often provide suggestions through conferences and PowerPoint presentations. While we observe alterations in nature's patterns, many attribute these changes to human behavior and call for adjustments. However, I believe this shift occurs due to nature's inherent laws.
 
 Consider the fact that planet Earth was once in an ice age; what brought about the current state are its natural laws. This suggests that nature is indifferent to our actions, tending to itself. Our responsibility lies in managing our lives effectively. Nature's primary concerns involve the growth, procreation, demise, and decay of its inhabitants. Nothing more, nothing less.",musings
Time Pass,"Upon retirement; individuals often grapple with detaching from the routine imposed by their profession, which nearly stripped them of their identity. Consequently, the phrase ""time pass"" frequently arises. But what does it genuinely imply?
 
 It is essential to acknowledge our inability to control time, as it waits for no one. 
 
 In moments of idleness, refrain from lamenting boredom and instead embrace the freedom to pursue your desires, which were once hindered by work obligations. Now, seize the chance to learn the art of enjoying your own company, you won't feel lonely though you may be alone your cherished memories will come to your rescue.
 
 This provides mental nourishment and aids in remaining present in each moment. Be vigilant not to squander even a minute without full engagement, for wasting sixty seconds means forfeiting valuable opportunities.
 
 In future instances of time pass, remind yourself that every day is a new day and not a continuation of yesterday.","musings, memories"
Religion's Hypothesis,"The primary source of belief in the supernatural stems from an insecurity we have nurtured: religion, a human-made concept. What is this insecurity? The answer lies in death.
 
 Naturally, all living beings possess inherent traits for survival, striving to any extent to achieve it. In other words, it is an animal world of survival. However, as humans, we differentiate ourselves from other beings due to our rational approach. To coexist harmoniously, we developed religion.
 
 Today, religion serves as a means to evade death and even suggests that life is immortal if one adheres to its teachings. This assurance of life after death can be better or worse, depending on how one lives their first life. Consequently, followers are often left confused, desiring heaven but unwilling to die on earth.
 
 Hence, my advice is not to worry about life after death; live while you are alive instead of merely surviving. The debate surrounding God's existence remains open; one is free to choose their deity based on personal comfort. As long as your beliefs help you accept life's finiteness and encourage making the best of your time on earth.
 
 Also, it's worth pondering – if life was eternal, would the notion of a deity exist?",musings
"Prayer, Insecurity, and Self-Confidence","I often notice individuals praying fervently, seemingly due to insecurities. 
 It is essential to distinguish between what is within our control and what is not. Excessive prayer may, in fact, undermine our self-confidence. As the adage goes, God helps those who help themselves.
 
 In essence, employ your intellect to recognize that many anxieties are self-generated; thus, the solutions or gratitude expressed reside within you. Prayer is not a transaction for a return but rather a process of reconciliation with oneself. This ultimately aids in accepting truth and allowing one's mind and body to live harmoniously. 
 
 Start living your prayers, for all the answers are within you.",musings
Enjoy what you do,"Enjoy what you do"" is common advice for new ventures. However, it's important to distinguish between ""enjoy"" and ""for enjoyment"" in this context.
 
 Activities ""for enjoyment"" are hobbies, not profit-driven pursuits. Many ventures fail when entrepreneurs confuse these categories. Unlike hobbies, which have flexible time and cost constraints, businesses operate within strict parameters.
 
 When hobbies evolve into businesses, they demand a fundamental shift in approach. Business isn't for the risk-averse; every venture faces potential failure despite careful planning. Therefore, thorough preparation for setbacks is essential.
 
 In business, success often stems from intangible factors that aren't immediately apparent. Acknowledging these subtle influences is crucial in understanding a business's current position.
 In essence, if pursuing your passion isn't an option, find ways to appreciate your obligations—that's the core of business.",musings
Randomness,"I must confess, I am somewhat inebriated while writing this, but I am determined to record my thoughts as they currently stand. Today, I experienced the power of unplanned events, which turned out to be one of my most memorable days. We often focus on planning to such an extent that it robs us of the unexpected, especially when it isn't about consequential matters.
 
 In this particular instance, we set out for one event but ended up somewhere else entirely, and had a fantastic time. I feel compelled to mention the name of the place, as it added a certain flavor to the experience: a restaurant called ""Seven Short One Long."" Admittedly, the name made little sense to me at first, but ultimately it proved worthy due to its culinary delights, enjoyable music, and the local brew Feni. The company of my friends only enhanced the experience.
 
 So, dear readers, when things don't go according to plan, don't be disheartened; instead, embrace randomness and give it a chance. You won't regret it.","memories, musings, random"
A Cleaner Wardrobe,"A wardrobe, often seen as merely a storage for our attire, holds much more significance to me. Indeed, attire is important, but when I open a wardrobe, I see it as a reflection of my conscience. Within it, I find two distinct sections: the current wardrobe I actively use and the overcrowded area filled with possessions.
 
 We tend to cling to these possessions, even if they no longer fit or serve a purpose. Reluctant to part with them, we convince ourselves that one day they will be useful again. However, I propose that your wardrobe mirrors your character and should be maintained like a clear conscience.
 
 Without delving too deeply into philosophy, let me offer some advice: declutter your wardrobe. Dispose of items that are no longer in use or pass them on to someone who might benefit from them. This act not only frees up space but also teaches you to share the good things you once enjoyed.
 
 By keeping minimal possessions that others may cherish rather than discard after we're gone, we reveal our true character. So begin with your wardrobe and cultivate a lean lifestyle.",musings
Identity and Adaptation,"Identity: I possess my own, as it should be. To maintain self-confidence, embracing this truth is crucial. This doesn't imply living in isolation; rather, master the art of adapting and adopting to surrounding forces while honoring one's identity. Our uniqueness enriches our existence.
 
 It's essential to recognize our interdependent existence and learn to maneuver for optimal results. We often hear the term identity crisis and associate it with superficial outward behavior. However, a crisis can also stem from an inward attitude attempting to avoid an explosion. Clinging onto such an attitude causes an implosion at your core, depriving you of self-belief - the worst form of identity crisis.
 
 Be outwardly confident in being yourself. Remember, you won't find another You.",musings
The Art of Laziness,"Laziness is indeed something.
 
 Far from nothing, laziness often stands in contrast to its praised counterpart, busyness. Society today tends to overlook the subtle art of being lazy. As activity take center stage, productivity is seldom questioned. We strive for action, yet few acknowledge that laziness can also serve as a quiet pursuit.
 
 Laziness is often misunderstood. Being lazy doesn't imply an absence of thought; in fact, one may think more in such circumstances. It's the action that gets delayed, allowing for a thorough examination of pros and cons, ultimately benefiting the decision-making process. At times, a lazy individual may deliver superior results when entrusted with an important task.",musings
Music and its Magic,"""Music to my ears"" is a statement often made when receiving pleasant news. The power of sound can either calm or excite our minds, depending on the genre chosen. It's hard to imagine life without music, as it transcends even religion in guiding our lives. Without music, life would be rather mundane.
 
 Don't mistake music for mere sound; it's the artistry in delivering those sounds. If there is no art involved, it becomes noise - quite different from music. However, one must consider that what may be music to one person could be noise to another; it's highly subjective. Nevertheless, when all elements harmonize, music stirs the soul.
 
 Make a habit of listening to music at least once a day, even if just for a few minutes. It will revitalize your mind. And of course, remember to thank the musicians.",musings
Canine Companionship,"Meet my cherished companion, Whisky. The name suits him well, as I adore both him and the beverage. I refrain from labeling him a mere ""dog,"" for we have often misused this term to describe a difficult existence. Whisky transcends such a label; he is, in fact, a king. He has his way, whether one likes it or not.
 
 Whisky possesses an uncanny understanding of commands before they are given and displays defiance before requests are made. At times overly energetic, the veterinarian suggested calming music for dogs – astonishingly, the same genre I use to soothe myself.
 
 It is said that humans are educated; one cannot help but wonder which esteemed institution Whisky attended. From now on, let us refrain from equating a challenging life with that of a dog's. Instead, attribute it to the owner's circumstances.","family, musings"
Redefining Poverty,"In today's world, the focus on alleviating poverty often revolves around material poverty. We tend to think of poverty mostly as a lack of food, shelter, and clothing, and leaders and religious figures emphasize serving the poor as a noble act. However, I must ask: what makes one feel wealthy enough to serve the poor? If we only view poverty as material, then perhaps having extra money qualifies us to help.
 
 But there is more to poverty than material circumstances; lack of attitudes such as gratitude, integrity, and equality contributes to the poverty of mindset. Some people may have enough but still feel poor, or their concern for others' well-being diminishes if someone else has more. This mindset must also be addressed.
 
 The notion of poverty extends beyond materialism. It isn't solely about financial aid or empathy for those with less; sometimes, those we deem ""poor"" possess a richer attitude towards life than their wealthier counterparts. We must recognize that we are all impoverished in our own ways.",musings
Betrayal and Trust Dynamics,"Betrayal is a one-way street—you either betray or feel betrayed. More often, feeling betrayed is our choice.
 
 Trust, the foundation that makes betrayal possible, is an investment we make. When returns diminish, we cry betrayal. Yet trading trust always carries risk. The solution? Trust with safeguards or without expectation of return.
 
 When betrayed, we cast others as enemies—but enemies are friendship's aftermath. Building relationships without expectations reduces the likelihood of creating adversaries. The pain of friends becoming foes remains our choice.
 
 Consider this: Accept people as they are, assigning them fitting roles in your life. As CEO of your existence, manage your relationships accordingly.",musings
New Year's Reflection,"As December ends, we anticipate the new year with resolutions born from our acknowledged flaws and hopes for improvement. We exchange 'Happy New Year' greetings in this spirit.
 
 In our digital age, mass-connecting has become effortless. Receiving hundreds of New Year wishes—and the obligation to respond—often reduces this tradition to a mechanical task, drawing quiet complaints.
 
 I once felt ashamed, catching myself grudgingly wishing someone happiness. This moment of self-awareness became pivotal—a call to align my words with genuine intent. Recognizing and working to overcome this human inconsistency is my resolution for 2024.
 
 A Happy New Year, indeed.",musings
The Paradox of Sinlessness,"A truly sinless life, if taken to its logical extreme, would be utterly devoid of value. Yet we often strive to adhere to such moral standards, thereby embracing hypocrisy at its core. Sins, as we call them, include lust, lies, and cheating.
 
 If these acts did not exist, life would be rather dull. Without lust, there would be little incentive to dress well. To understand lies, one must first question the nature of truth and the extent to which it should be communicated. Cheating is subjective, since anything kept secret can be interpreted as deceitful. Secrets often form the backbone of business and professional endeavors.
 
 These few examples illustrate the difficulty of living a sinless life. It is safe to say that anyone claiming to live without sin is committing a sin itself. So why vilify these acts that are commonplace in everyday life? Is it merely for the sake of earning heavenly merit?
 
 Try living just one day without sinful thoughts, actions, or words. Chances are you'll find yourself longing for hellish pursuits instead.
 
 Don't fret over sins as they have been portrayed.
 Perhaps it's time for an amendment: simply learn to live comfortably within your conscience.",musings
Faith,"What is faith, if not trusting oneself? Faith within ; would it not yield the same result? Why must we rely on others or religious doctrine? How entangled have we become in this web?
 
 In good times, we often have faith in ourselves, believing it will endure. So why do we shift it during challenging times? Instead, let's channel that energy into a self-sufficient faith, unburdened by dependencies.
 
 Facing reality becomes simpler with this approach. They say faith can move mountains, which means seeking answers within and shedding the weight of self-created obstacles. Each individual possesses the ability to discern expectations from possibilities and find peace. Yet societal norms lure us into believing in miracles.
 
 While no one has complete control over life's challenges, we often seek external saviors. This mindset validates miracles and leaves us vulnerable to exploitation. To avoid this trap, have faith in your understanding and make decisions best suited for you.
 
 Miracles or not, nothing lasts forever. Believing in oneself and maintaining faith until the end ‚Äì now that's a true miracle.",musings
The Value of Time,"I've frequently employed the phrase 'time is money,' primarily because we value it with money. I have been uttering this phrase many times. However, I eventually realized the inadequacy of using 'money' to represent time's worth.
 
 Indeed, time surpasses the value of money; it is irreplaceable and cannot be bought. The notion that we waste time is a misconception; we always utilize it in some manner or another. We merely claim to have wasted time when we cannot measure its return in material terms, forgetting that time's true worth is incalculable.
 
 The major distinction between money and time lies in our awareness of their quantities. We can know how much money we possess, but we are uncertain about our remaining time.
 Earning money is not inherently problematic; just ensure that you don't become so captivated by it that you equate it with precious time.",musings
Pereira Family Legacy,"""Knock! Knock!
 For Your Twenty-Two Great-Great-Grandchildren
 
 The Legacy of Luis Francisco Pereira
 Luis Francisco Pereira, an entrepreneur and your great-great-grandfather, journeyed from Succor to Diwar Island in the early 19th century. Although I regret not knowing your great-great-grandmother's name, she likely found Diwar's beauty irresistible.
 
 Their granddaughter, Isabel Cristalina Pereira, shared stories of walking with her grandmother between Diwar and Succor over Chorao's hills. They'd stay overnight before returning with provisions from relatives.
 
 Luis Francisco established a tavern at Diwar; its structure still stands at Toleacho Bandh (meaning ""embankment of a pond""). He traveled to Succor weekly for supplies but later obtained a house from his father's employer to expand his business on the island. This led to the family's relocation to what is now Armacar Niwas.
 
 Luis had one son, João Caitano Pereira. Luis passed away young, and João chose a seafaring career. During a trip home, he smuggled a gun, earning him the nickname ""Armacar"" (Konkani for ""gun possession""), which has been proudly inherited since.
 
 João married Ana Maria Pascoal and had two children: Luis Antonio and Cristaline Isabel Pereira.
 João, too, died young aboard ship. Thanks to the intervention of kind souls, a burial at sea was avoided, and he was laid to rest at the nearest European port.
 
 A fortnight later, the family received a telegram in Portuguese, revealing the tragic news of João Caitan's death from cholera and his land burial. This tale was recounted by his daughter, Cristalin, then around fifteen, and her brother Luis Antonio Pereira, a mere five years old.
 
 Luis Antonio harbored one lingering regret: not knowing his father's final resting place. He would often speculate about European countries and yearned to visit them for closure. Sadly, it never came to pass.
 
 Luis Antonio married Maria Antonia (Alor), and they were blessed with ten children—one of whom is your parent.
 
 And thus unfolds the story of a house called Armacar Niwas.

Nostalgia Versus Progress,"Often, I hear the sentiment, primarily from Goans, that we genuinely miss the olden days. To some extent, we do long for those times, but why has this become a central topic nowadays? Upon reflection, I'd like to ask if you miss the old mud roads, life without electricity, unhygienic pig toilets, cooking on firewood, walking long distances, or lacking a telephone for communication. Numerous aspects have improved since our youth, and we've played a part in these advancements.
 
 Yes, there are always trade-offs and changes in life; however, it's time we embrace the remaining goodness of our land. As things continue to change and may not meet our expectations or desires, we must focus on understanding why people are compelled to adapt. People face various compulsions and must make choices based on necessity rather than preference.
 
 While we've progressed significantly and may reminisce about the past or want to watch our neighbors climb coconut trees as we relax nearby our swimming pool , we must remember that everyone has aspirations. Although we often complain about government actions, it's important to note that the government isn't a separate entity. We, the people, shape our circumstances; thus, if the majority is discontent with their lifestyle, they will seek comfort whichever way possible.
 To be in peace with oneself just imagine what would be your choice if faced with such circumstances.","memories, musings"
Intoxicated Wholeness,"When I don't compare, I feel whole and complete. Curiously, this sense of completeness often occurs when I've had a drink. A thought-provoking observation, considering I'm not inebriated. Why does my self-belief seem to require a slightly altered state?
 
 Perhaps it's because the world appears different when my mind is clear. Maybe the desire to please society influences my thoughts. Though uncertain, there's no denying that I feel distinct when slightly intoxicated – more connected to myself and at ease with the circumstances of my existence.
 
 Surrounded by life's abundance, I find joy in simple pleasures: Life can be contemplative, our thoughts shifting between sobriety and intoxication.
 
 Wouldn't it be fascinating if the entire world experienced this state simultaneously? Perhaps that's why Jesus turned water into wine – a divine concoction designed to bring happiness and elevate our spirits. Let us raise a glass to this concoction and embrace what some may call the Holy Spirit.",musings
Embracing Inevitable Change,"Acknowledge that change is an ever-present aspect of life. Everything, including ourselves, alters each moment, even if we don't realise it. We often observe changes in our environment and grumble if they displease us.
 
 Nonetheless, it's crucial to accept that no change is inherently good or bad - what benefits one person may harm another. Rather than opposing change, adjust your perspective and acknowledge its inescapability.
 
 Bear in mind that while you can control many aspects of life, change itself remains beyond your grasp. The optimal approach to living is by adapting and finding solace in this realization, for the world will persistently evolve around us.",musings
Reflections and Remembrance,"Echoes of a Shared Past
 
 Photography prompts reminiscing,
 As I discovered when an childhood friend's group photo taken some years ago resurfaced.
 A snapshot bridging past and present.
 
 Once equal playmates,
 Now a subtle disparity lingers.
 We measure ourselves by achievements, seemingly distancing from cherished memories, as if the past held no value.
 What changed? Nothing monumental,
 Only our thoughts diverged, as some amassed more than others, altering perceptions, yet at our core, we remain unchanged.
 
 Thankful for the preserved memory,
 Two have since left this world.

Redefining Enough,"Enough - a word so casually uttered. Delve deeper, and one may uncover contrasting definitions of what is enough, or even more than enough. Life revolves around materialism, status, and fame - all encapsulated within the concept of 'enough.' Yet when applied, the meaning shifts. Many of us stumble into the trap of never knowing what is truly enough, leading to hatred and greed.
 
 To overcome this dilemma, one must reflect on their life and recognize the trap they are captured in. An effective method to detach oneself and gain perspective is to transcend beyond Earth. Our existence on this planet feels all-encompassing; even our age is dictated by its rotations and revolutions. But venturing beyond Earth reveals that our lifespan is minuscule compared to the universe's timeline.
 
 This realization redefines our understanding of 'enough,' allowing us to cherish life and smile at its fleeting nature. We can then rejoice in others' happiness and find contentment in imperfection. Life need not be perfect; it should be fulfilling. Embrace this transcendent thought process, and nothing will hold you back from rejoicing in the gift of life.
 
 For my sixty-fifth birthday, I bestow upon myself this delightful present.",musings
Embracing Controlled Madness,"Madness, in its own right, need not always imply psychiatric chaos. Sometimes, it's essential to deviate from our routine and embrace a touch of spontaneity. Stepping out of our comfort zone can lead to new discoveries and experiences that would otherwise remain hidden.
 
 We often become fixated on established patterns, such as breakfast in the morning and dinner at night. However, it's refreshing to occasionally break from routine. Many of our frustrations stem from feeling trapped within these norms, leading to dissatisfaction.
 
 To combat this stagnation, try something different. For instance, take the bus instead of driving your car - not to save money, but to gain new experiences. Dare to be late for work one day and embrace the change it brings.
 
 It's crucial to give our emotions space to breathe. If you tire of your usual music choices, try reciting a childhood poem to transport yourself back in time and gain fresh perspectives.
 Embrace these moments of spontaneous joy; you won't regret it.
 Life becomes truly beautiful when lived spontaneously.","musings, random"
Randomness and Routine,"I love randomness because it makes life fun and free from too many worries. Random events give you a nice surprise since you don't expect much. But, I've learned that having a routine is also important to stay sane. Without a routine, randomness loses its charm.
 
 During my holiday, I enjoyed the first week of randomness. However, after that, I missed my daily routine.","musings, random"
Reflecting on Independence Day,"On this day, celebrated as our country's Independence Day, one can't help but feel nostalgic. I remember the early morning ritual of ironing my uniform and putting on white canvas shoes. The warmth of the heated clothes and the pep in my walk with those clean white shoes, ready for the march parade, brought comfort, knowing it was still a holiday. Other than that, nothing much seems to excite me.
 
 Being the 74th year of celebration, I thought I needed to go beyond the usual and change that narrative.
 
 All these years, our political establishment made sure to remind the nation that we freed ourselves from invaders. They focused all their energies on that, making it more of a geographical achievement. So much so, our patriotism is gauged by our reaction to what is happening at our borders and beyond, not within. It is about time we shift our focus inward. This is not to be pessimistic because we have achieved a lot since independence. At the same time, many things we preach but seldom practice are becoming norms, and this trend is disturbing. I am listing a few:
 
 We have elections but don't respect the verdict.
 
 We want development but don't want to pay taxes.
 
 We want a government job but don't want to work.
 
 Having a criminal record is an added qualification to fight elections.
 
 We are more scared of the police than burglars.
 
 We clean our houses but mess up the neighbourhood.
 
 We take pride in second-generation Indian-origin citizens of another country and forget to applaud our own.
 
 The list goes on. 
 
 All is not lost. So on this day, let us all Indians resolve to think about the above and make amends for real independence.","memories, musings"
Peter's Bar,"Peters: a name that rings a bell. On Sundays, we'd visit not just because it was a bar, but because it was a place with a difference. It was here we would solve the world's problems within an hour.
 
 As friends, it was our ritual to meet, though eventually, I had to drop a name from the list.
 
 I walked that path alone, yet never felt lonely in my solitude. Something was in the air; all one needed was to be there.
 
 A thousand times I visited, my seat even knew my name. But each time, it was different; it never stayed the same. Our sessions began at noon, often lasting past three. The gracious owner handed over the key.
 
 Now Peters is closed, and I'm told there's a wall. I haven't seen it and wished it was not to be. Not out of arrogance, but because I have my frozen memories sealed; one day, I know they'll be revealed.","memories, musings"
The Value of Youthful Friendships,"After attending an eighteenth birthday party, I was amazed by the raw camaraderie among the young people there. A question came to my mind: how many of them would remember this event when they become senior citizens?
 
 I started recalling my own younger days. To my surprise, I could remember many gatherings in great detail. This led me to conclude that true friendships are often formed when we are young and yet to blossom.
 
 Once you blossom, your success attracts many, but they come and go with the tide. It's important to differentiate between friends and acquaintances. However, there are exceptions to this rule, as some acquaintances might become close friends or even life partners.
 
 That being said, the most genuine friendships are often formed during our twenties. Beyond that, people tend to recognize you for what you are rather than who you are.
 
 Hold on to the friendships from your youth; they are priceless. Meet your old friends with a warm hug whenever possible, and don't reduce these friendships to merely sending emojis.","memories, musings"
Weddings of the 70s: A Nostalgic Celebration,"Weddings in the 1970s were quite remarkable. During that time, everyone eagerly anticipated a local wedding. Preparations would begin one to two weeks before the event, creating an atmosphere filled with excitement and music.
 
 A locally-made shamiana with delightful flower arrangements was essential, and the celebration would last from 10 PM until 6 AM. Snacks, soft drinks, beer, and local fusion cuisine were staples at these weddings.
 
 However, there were occasional disputes within families over minor etiquette lapses. As the 1980s approached, I found myself serving as master of ceremonies for several weddings. Although my attire wasn't quite what it is today, my speaking abilities secured me the role. Over four to five years, I must have officiated at about 25 weddings, or perhaps more.
 
 As master of ceremonies, I had control over various aspects of the event, such as song selection, dance styles, and even bar service. Though announcing 'The bar is closed' may sound embarrassing nowadays, it was part of the package.
 
 An amusing custom back then was the tag dance. If a guest desired a particular partner who refused to dance, they could request a tag dance. This impromptu dance allowed anyone to join in and tag their desired partner. While some may have resisted this tradition, it was devised because most girls were very selective and would sometimes refuse to dance casually, saying 'I am engaged,' leaving the poor boy to walk back dejected.
 
 All this was part of the charm of weddings during those times. Nowadays, celebrations wrap up by 10 PM, but those weddings remain unforgettable parties.","memories, musings"
Happiness Within,"Dependent happiness often involves comparing ourselves to others and focusing on external factors. While it's natural to care about our relationships and the well-being of loved ones, it's crucial to recognise the importance of personal happiness.
 
 Nowadays, society is fixated on the idea of being rich and famous. Most people don't think about the value of happiness.
 
 True happiness comes from within, and we must allocate time for self-care and independent joy. Remember that when we pass away, our world goes with us. Therefore, make an effort to experience genuine contentment by dedicating a portion of your life exclusively to yourself.
 
 That being said, once you share happiness with others, it magnifies. In return, partaking in others' happiness sustains it.
 
 Any endeavour one undertakes must please yourself. In other words, be selfish to be selfless.",musings
Mindful Communication,"Communication is often taken for granted. 
 
 Most know it's a two-way process, but this is conveniently forgotten when one feels aggrieved and wants to counter instantly, sometimes without merit. 
 
 It's human to react in such a manner, but one must be mindful of the consequences, which can lead to breaking relationships. 
 
 It's fair to say that the main ingredient of a worthy relationship is good communication. 
 
 For good communication, it's important to listen rather than be in a hurry to respond or counter. 
 
 Otherwise, you might regret it later. 
 
 Most communication fails because we have pre-empted conclusions or preconceived notions about the person and not the subject. So, it's best to corroborate the subject mentally before responding.
 
 As it's said, all that happens impacts you based on how you react to it. 
 
 Good communication keeps bias out and focuses on merit.",musings
My Mother,"Number fifty is known as a golden celebration, but today, 30th June 2022, takes me back to the same day in 1972 - the day our mother died. Today marks her fiftieth death anniversary.
 
 One of my golden memories of my mother remains vivid. It was the month of May, and it's still a fresh memory that gives me goosebumps even now. I was admitted to the pediatrics ward of Old Goa Medical College for treatment of rheumatoid fever. I spent twelve days there alone. Every night, I missed my mother but consoled myself, being a thirteen-year-old and her fourth child. I understood she couldn't be there because she had six of my younger siblings to take care of, but still, I couldn't stop shedding tears.
 
 The golden moment arrived when my mother visited me unexpectedly. It was evening, and I was on my bed just gazing around when I saw my beautiful mother walking towards me. She was wearing a white sari with jade green polka dots. The sight of her was so overwhelming that I almost froze with excitement. I can still feel that embrace and smell her scent.
 
 I was discharged towards the end of May, and as June started, the school routine resumed. But there was more in store for us that month. Unexpectedly, our mother fell ill with what seemed like a common cold. Her condition worsened, and she had to be hospitalized on June 28th at Goa Medical College, barely a month after my discharge. Unfortunately, unlike my case, her life ended on 30th June.
 
 The tragedy unfolded in an unexplainable way. As a thirteen-year-old child, I stood by my mother's body for some time that night, trying to make sense of what had happened. I couldn't comprehend it and retreated to the adjacent room, where I cried until I fell asleep.
 
 I dreamt that it was all just a nightmare - that my mother wasn't really dead - but that momentary relief only awakened me to the harsh reality that she truly was gone.
 
 I still miss my mother, but I find solace in talking to her every morning as part of my daily ritual.","family, memories, musings"
Celebrating Family and Tradition,"As I was driving today to the house of my ancestors, Armacar Niwas, a wild thought excited me. I am going to get the house ready for my son's wedding. It made me think about the generations who lived in that house. It was so overwhelming to realise that most of the descendants, if not all, will be present in body or in thought. This feeling was beyond luxury.
 
 I felt indebted to the values passed on to us by our parents. Though short in time, I could vividly recall my father's saying – 'Ektain Rawat'. He often said it in an inebriated state, as I am right now.
 
 Cheers to the values imbibed in us.
 
 Viva Armacars!","family, memories, musings"
School and Life,"Growing up in the village of Diwar, my childhood was both interesting and challenging. As one of ten siblings who lost our parents at a young age, we lived together in our ancestral home and faced tough times without them.
 
 My school journey wasn't easy either. I often felt like a rebel and struggled with feeling different from other children. Even though we had plenty of food, laughter, and love at home, some things still seemed unfair to me - like not having proper uniforms.
 
 One incident stands out: when I was in 8th grade, a teacher pulled me by my ill-fitting shirt and made an insensitive comment about it being my father's shirt. This made me so angry that I stormed out of her French class and never returned until 10th grade. During those three years away from studying French, I spent much time outside school, lost in philosophical thoughts.
 
 I gave up on my academics, being rebellious and searching for answers. The eureka moment struck me when I recalled my father's expectations of me becoming a lawyer. This realization came during my routine monthly medical treatment at Goa Medical College. I picked up a cigarette from the GMC canteen (cigarettes were sold in the canteen at that time). Luckily, I got it for free as my friend was manning the cash counter.
 
 I went to the nearby park, now known as Mahavir Park, next to old GMC. I questioned myself: Why? Why not fulfill my father's expectations? From then on, my life's trajectory changed, and I completed my law degree, though I didn't pursue it to its logical conclusion.
 
 But here I am today, with no complaints about who I have become.","family, memories, musings"
The Weight of Our Choices,"While making choices may seem simple, their implications become significant once we commit to a path. We often make decisions hastily without proper consideration, accepting them without questioning their long-term impact. This lack of careful deliberation happens when we don't engage our critical thinking.
 
 When we take time to consciously evaluate our options before deciding, the outcomes can be dramatically different. Many of our decisions are unconsciously shaped by societal influences, which we internalize as our own choices. While such automatic decision-making might be harmless in daily routines, it becomes crucial to make well-informed decisions for life-changing events like marriage.
 
 A common example is when people mistake infatuation for love, failing to recognize that infatuation is temporary and may not evolve into lasting affection. In such important matters, it's essential to carefully explore all options and make informed decisions rather than later lamenting poor choices.","musings, family"
The Paradox of Divine Belief,"God is humanity's greatest invention. It's hard to imagine life without this concept. Yet humans didn't stop at just one deity. They created many gods, influenced by their moods and egos. Every kingdom had its own deity, which the wealthy followed blindly, while the commoners were forced to do the same.
 
 Religion was, and still is, used as a tool to rule. Now there is a struggle for superiority among followers, while the gods are left to fend for themselves. The irony is that they haven't managed to divide Heaven or Hell.
 
 Followers comfort themselves by saying it's the path one chooses to reach the destination that matters, even though the destination remains the same. Here lies the confusion: which is the ideal path? What difference does it make to Heaven?
 
 Where does this path start? I pondered. The straightforward answer is that it begins here on Earth. And where does it end? Here on Earth itself.
 
 So it does matter to choose the right path to experience Heaven on Earth. It need not be religious, but it should be full of goodness.
 
 There is only one Heaven because one cannot split the Earth.",musings
Me,"My Diary
 
 For nearly a decade, I've recorded my experiences, expectations, and candid thoughts based on the situations and surroundings I've encountered.
 
 Reviewing these entries, I marvel at the sheer volume and diversity of topics, despite some repetition and contradictions. This only reinforces that these writings are unfiltered reflections of my daily life.
 
 Initially, organizing these notes wasn't a priority. However, a fortunate intuition and access to my son Louis's AudioPen app helped transform these scattered musings into coherent text. I am truly grateful for this invaluable tool.
 
 These observations aim not to impress or persuade others without merit but to satisfy my curiosity. A random reading may serve a purpose; thus, I wish to share my thoughts with the ARMACARS young family members, showing them that life offers more than what's visible on the surface.
 
 Additionally, I want to share these reflections with friends who have tolerated my intrusion through my postings and discussions of such observations over time.
 
 Before printing these entries, I felt the need to reflect on my experiences and recall the moments that inspired them. This exercise confirmed that my life thus far at sixty-six has been akin to a roller coaster - sometimes up, sometimes down - but at no point have I regretted my existence. I strongly believe that every day is a new day, not a continuation of yesterday, and I remain excited to discover what tomorrow holds for me.
 
 I express my heartfelt gratitude to my wife, Ruby, and my children, Golda and Louis. I sincerely thank them for allowing me to be myself.
