Social media can be blamed for much of the restlessness in today's society. The term "like-minded" has become increasingly relevant, though one may wish it had remained a simple concept. Many individuals connect on social media platforms, claiming to be like-minded.
 
 If you find yourself on such a platform, it is wise to carefully filter content that does not align with your preferences. Alternatively, consider scantily using Facebook and Twitter, where opinions are often met with contention.
 
 For the sake of peace, make your world a little smaller. We were never designed to know every global event. If you find yourself addicted to social media, try satisfying the craving with a cigarette instead.
