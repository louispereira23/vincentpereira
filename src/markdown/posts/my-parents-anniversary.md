Today is a special day in my life, as it's not only Mother's Day but also the wedding anniversary of my parents. I recently came across their marriage details written by our father in our family Bible, and it has made me quite nostalgic.
 
 Though I knew they married young, the records confirmed that our dad was 24 and our mother just 21 when they tied the knot in Bombay. I'm unsure about how many people from Diwar attended their wedding, but I know that my auntie and my mother's family were present.
 
 The expectations during that era were different; companionship seemed to be more important than high ambitions. This makes me reflect on how sometimes small things matter much more than what we can hold on to in life.
