Acknowledge that change is an ever-present aspect of life. Everything, including ourselves, alters each moment, even if we don't realise it. We often observe changes in our environment and grumble if they displease us.
 
 Nonetheless, it's crucial to accept that no change is inherently good or bad - what benefits one person may harm another. Rather than opposing change, adjust your perspective and acknowledge its inescapability.
 
 Bear in mind that while you can control many aspects of life, change itself remains beyond your grasp. The optimal approach to living is by adapting and finding solace in this realization, for the world will persistently evolve around us.
