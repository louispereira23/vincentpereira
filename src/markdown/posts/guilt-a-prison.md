Prison: upon hearing this word, one often envisions crime, barbed wire, and towering walls – all symbols of restricted freedom. Prisons are commonly associated with punishment meted out by authorities for proven wrongdoing. Yet, if a crime remains unproven, are we truly innocent?
 
 According to the law, we are – and justifiably so. However, at this point, we may imprison our own conscience by telling a lie and subsequently experiencing guilt. Nature possesses its own methods; it does not rely on external prisons but rather imprisons us within ourselves. To savor genuine freedom, live by your conscience.
