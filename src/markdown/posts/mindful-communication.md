Communication is often taken for granted. 
 
 Most know it's a two-way process, but this is conveniently forgotten when one feels aggrieved and wants to counter instantly, sometimes without merit. 
 
 It's human to react in such a manner, but one must be mindful of the consequences, which can lead to breaking relationships. 
 
 It's fair to say that the main ingredient of a worthy relationship is good communication. 
 
 For good communication, it's important to listen rather than be in a hurry to respond or counter. 
 
 Otherwise, you might regret it later. 
 
 Most communication fails because we have pre-empted conclusions or preconceived notions about the person and not the subject. So, it's best to corroborate the subject mentally before responding.
 
 As it's said, all that happens impacts you based on how you react to it. 
 
 Good communication keeps bias out and focuses on merit.
