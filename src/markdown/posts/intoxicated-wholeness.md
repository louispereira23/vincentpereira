When I don't compare, I feel whole and complete. Curiously, this sense of completeness often occurs when I've had a drink. A thought-provoking observation, considering I'm not inebriated. Why does my self-belief seem to require a slightly altered state?
 
 Perhaps it's because the world appears different when my mind is clear. Maybe the desire to please society influences my thoughts. Though uncertain, there's no denying that I feel distinct when slightly intoxicated – more connected to myself and at ease with the circumstances of my existence.
 
 Surrounded by life's abundance, I find joy in simple pleasures: Life can be contemplative, our thoughts shifting between sobriety and intoxication.
 
 Wouldn't it be fascinating if the entire world experienced this state simultaneously? Perhaps that's why Jesus turned water into wine – a divine concoction designed to bring happiness and elevate our spirits. Let us raise a glass to this concoction and embrace what some may call the Holy Spirit.
