This morning is unlike any other, as the date November 15th, 2022 will forever remain etched in our memories. Our cherished brother Joe has passed away. While we mourn, we also rejoice in the fact that he was born and became an integral part of our lives.
 
 We were honored to have him as our leader. Despite occasional disagreements, mutual respect always prevailed â€“ a virtue instilled in us by our parents, who taught us to respect our elders. Joe was the eldest among us, and his absence leaves a void difficult to fill.
 
 Nevertheless, we shall persevere and uphold the pride of declaring that "We are Ten." Although our ranks have begun to dwindle, forcing us to say "We were Ten," the number ten will endure until the end.
