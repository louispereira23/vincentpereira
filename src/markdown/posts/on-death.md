Death Speaks:
 
 Why am I maligned in life, yet glorified once I strike? Humanity ought to recognize that life's splendor exists due to me. Without my presence, life itself would cease. People must comprehend that I am the cause for celebrating life - all this without expense or petition.
 
 All they need do is relish their time. Do not inquire how long; it is not intended to be known. 
 Fear me not, though many succumb to this misperception.
 
 Rather than fretting about your destination after death, wonder where you came from. To that place, I shall return you.
