In stagnant times, when dullness seems to prevail, give yourself a chance and embrace 'ism' - a term I've coined for 'now, the present.' By this, I mean to set aside the past and future, as most of our worries stem from them. Believe in the power of now, as it exists in every fraction of a second.
 
 Acknowledge that you are here despite the so-called impediments one might envisage, and embrace that this is all that matters.
 
 Master living in the present, and your day will pass without grievances.
 Do not anticipate seeing the hour hand of a watch move; you will be disappointed. However, rest assured that it does complete a 360-degree rotation each day.
