Life begins with nothing and appears to end with everything, which ultimately means nothing. In life, everything is nothing, and nothing is everything. Our journey is false if based solely on objectivity. The only true presence in your life is absolute consciousness, not dependency. This blissful state of mind is the ultimate goal, or in worldly terms, heaven. Here, it is acknowledged that even nothing holds value through detachment.
 
 The value of 10 is hidden within the numbers 0 to 10, yet we begin counting at 1. This oversight in our education suggests that everything starts from something, which is incorrect; it starts from nothing which is something. Be reminded that zero's value depends on which side its placed.
 
 Theistic religions emphasize objectivity, enticing followers with the prospect of holding onto or being rewarded with these objects after life's end. This notion is misguided.
 
 At a human level, we engage in this deception but should recognize that detachment is the key.
