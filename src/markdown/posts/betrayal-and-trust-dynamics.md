Betrayal is a one-way street—you either betray or feel betrayed. More often, feeling betrayed is our choice.
 
 Trust, the foundation that makes betrayal possible, is an investment we make. When returns diminish, we cry betrayal. Yet trading trust always carries risk. The solution? Trust with safeguards or without expectation of return.
 
 When betrayed, we cast others as enemies—but enemies are friendship's aftermath. Building relationships without expectations reduces the likelihood of creating adversaries. The pain of friends becoming foes remains our choice.
 
 Consider this: Accept people as they are, assigning them fitting roles in your life. As CEO of your existence, manage your relationships accordingly.
