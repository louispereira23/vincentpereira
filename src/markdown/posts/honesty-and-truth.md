Honesty extends beyond merely telling the truth; it also encompasses refraining from telling a lie . While these terms bear a resemblance, they differ significantly. One can be honest without necessarily revealing the whole truth.
 
 Truth may not always warrant disclosure, but lying burdens one for a lifetime,
 Honesty allows us to accept our imperfections. Circumstances may compel us to withhold truth, yet if it holds value, it shall ultimately triumph.
 
 Be honest to oneself.
