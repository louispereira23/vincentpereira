Meet my cherished companion, Whisky. The name suits him well, as I adore both him and the beverage. I refrain from labeling him a mere "dog," for we have often misused this term to describe a difficult existence. Whisky transcends such a label; he is, in fact, a king. He has his way, whether one likes it or not.
 
 Whisky possesses an uncanny understanding of commands before they are given and displays defiance before requests are made. At times overly energetic, the veterinarian suggested calming music for dogs â€“ astonishingly, the same genre I use to soothe myself.
 
 It is said that humans are educated; one cannot help but wonder which esteemed institution Whisky attended. From now on, let us refrain from equating a challenging life with that of a dog's. Instead, attribute it to the owner's circumstances.
