Living life without anxiety is best achieved through acceptance, particularly in trying times. It is only human for us to feel devastated upon hearing unexpected news, these are the moments our brains secrete less of the biochemical which excites us . Owing to our upbringing, we often entertain the same thought a thousand times, potentially leading to depression.
 
 At such instances, applying logic is crucial. While easier said than done, this is mainly because we rarely give it a chance. Take a moment to envision your near future â€“ you know you will eventually overcome these feelings. So, what stops us from feeling that way now, just as we would in time? It is our choice to live in ignorance of facts; facts we know but refuse to entertain.
