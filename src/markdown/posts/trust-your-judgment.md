Relying too much on others' advice can weaken your own judgment. When facing challenges, you might struggle to apply these principles. 
 Instead, seek answers within yourself; you often know what's best for you.
 
 Focus on discovering your true desires in life, whether it's related to studies, career, or relationships. Be genuinely nice instead of pretending; even if people don't respond positively, you'll feel good within.
