Laziness is indeed something.
 
 Far from nothing, laziness often stands in contrast to its praised counterpart, busyness. Society today tends to overlook the subtle art of being lazy. As activity take center stage, productivity is seldom questioned. We strive for action, yet few acknowledge that laziness can also serve as a quiet pursuit.
 
 Laziness is often misunderstood. Being lazy doesn't imply an absence of thought; in fact, one may think more in such circumstances. It's the action that gets delayed, allowing for a thorough examination of pros and cons, ultimately benefiting the decision-making process. At times, a lazy individual may deliver superior results when entrusted with an important task.
