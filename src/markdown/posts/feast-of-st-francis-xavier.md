As November approaches, the island of Diwar buzzes with anticipation for the novenas of St. Francis Xavier's Feast. In the 1970s, we would walk to the ferry, which connected us to a wonderland.
 
 Back then, Goa was primarily inhabited by Goans, so the fair was mostly run by Goans with a few visitors selling religious items. We even had our own restaurant, POP INN, a fitting name for young entrepreneurs seeking enjoyment and profit. Our friends frequented the establishment, providing business and lending a helping hand just for the fun of it.
 
 I remember the quote painted on the wall saying: "IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO, THEN PLEASE DON'T DO IT HERE" - a bold reminder to our friends to be productive.
 
 The highlight for me was the vespers night when less privileged individuals gathered to spend the evening with their local drum (ghumot), singing songs and attending the cross ladainha. A swig of local brew madachi feni kept spirits high. At dawn, they attended the feast day mass before making way for well-dressed attendees of the high mass.
 
 A notable feature of vespers night was matchmaking expeditions. Young girls from that community dressed elegantly, their faces displaying shy anticipation of a brighter future, while their parents eagerly attempted to arrange marriages.
 
 Nowadays, mobile phones have intruded upon this tradition. Nevertheless, I still attend vespers night in an effort to relive those cherished memories.
