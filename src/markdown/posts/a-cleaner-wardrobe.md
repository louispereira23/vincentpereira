A wardrobe, often seen as merely a storage for our attire, holds much more significance to me. Indeed, attire is important, but when I open a wardrobe, I see it as a reflection of my conscience. Within it, I find two distinct sections: the current wardrobe I actively use and the overcrowded area filled with possessions.
 
 We tend to cling to these possessions, even if they no longer fit or serve a purpose. Reluctant to part with them, we convince ourselves that one day they will be useful again. However, I propose that your wardrobe mirrors your character and should be maintained like a clear conscience.
 
 Without delving too deeply into philosophy, let me offer some advice: declutter your wardrobe. Dispose of items that are no longer in use or pass them on to someone who might benefit from them. This act not only frees up space but also teaches you to share the good things you once enjoyed.
 
 By keeping minimal possessions that others may cherish rather than discard after we're gone, we reveal our true character. So begin with your wardrobe and cultivate a lean lifestyle.
