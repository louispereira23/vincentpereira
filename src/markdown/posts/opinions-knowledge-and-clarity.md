Opinion: A view or judgment on something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge. The intriguing part is that it's not always grounded in facts or knowledge. Pause for a moment and consider how opinionated you are, and how much it governs your thought process. How much of it is truly based on facts or knowledge? For myself, I find the answer to be less than fifty percent. So why should such notions dominate most of my life?
 
 I've resolved to refrain from being overly opinionated and to seek facts and knowledge before accepting a statement as true. This endeavor has cleared much clutter from my mental storage, invigorating my pursuit of knowledge. It has bolstered my confidence in admitting, "I don't know." Furthermore, it has reinforced my belief that knowing you don't know is the essence of knowledge.
 
 Many a time, opinion had deceived me into thinking it was knowledge.
