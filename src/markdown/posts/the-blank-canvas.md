Blank ‚Äì a word that often elicits aversion, as it signifies emptiness. Yet, paradoxically, emptiness can hold more meaning than one might initially assume. Our inclination toward materialism has led us to fear the concept of emptiness.
 
 To foster creativity, humanity must learn the art of unlearning. Discarding redundant information allows us to start anew with fresh perspectives. In our ever-evolving world, mastering the skill of blanking one's mind and gaze is crucial.
 
 Embrace the blank, for it is within this emptiness that the sought-after Eureka moments arise. Empty the trash, and discover the attraction of being blank.
