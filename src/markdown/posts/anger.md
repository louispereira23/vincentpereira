Getting angry seldom solves an issue; rather, it tends to worsen it. A calm mind is crucial for addressing life's challenges.
 
 Consider these practices:
 1. Be mindful of others' emotions and avoid causing harm.
 2. Remember it takes two to create misunderstanding contemplate your actions leading to the issue and devise ways to make amends.
 3. Swift solutions require effort; evading problems or shirking responsibility won't help, as true resolutions stem from within. 
 4. Prioritize significant tasks over pressing ones when strategizing.
 5. A relaxed mindset aids in navigating life's obstacles.
 6. Embrace happiness, as it not only affects your mood but also positively impacts those around you. Contentment flourishes when we observe happiness radiating onto others due to our conduct â€“ that is what truly matters in life.
