Identity: I possess my own, as it should be. To maintain self-confidence, embracing this truth is crucial. This doesn't imply living in isolation; rather, master the art of adapting and adopting to surrounding forces while honoring one's identity. Our uniqueness enriches our existence.
 
 It's essential to recognize our interdependent existence and learn to maneuver for optimal results. We often hear the term identity crisis and associate it with superficial outward behavior. However, a crisis can also stem from an inward attitude attempting to avoid an explosion. Clinging onto such an attitude causes an implosion at your core, depriving you of self-belief - the worst form of identity crisis.
 
 Be outwardly confident in being yourself. Remember, you won't find another You.
