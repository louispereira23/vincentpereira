During a casual conversation with a friend, we both discovered our shared love for dogs. My friend mentioned that they changed their floor tiles to brown because they didn't want to see the dirt their dog brought in. However, I have white tiles and my dog comes in often as well. Instead of hiding the dirt, I prefer cleaning it up.
 
 Over time, it became difficult to clean the dirt every time my dog came inside. So I adjusted my mindset and started viewing my dog's paw prints as works of art, which put me at ease until it's cleaned. This change made me question if I was genuinely embracing this new perspective or just doing so out of convenience.
 
 Ultimately, who is right? Should one install brown tiles to mask the dirt or keep white ones that display paw prints more visibly? The answer remains uncertain.
