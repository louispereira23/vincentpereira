What is faith, if not trusting oneself? Faith within ; would it not yield the same result? Why must we rely on others or religious doctrine? How entangled have we become in this web?
 
 In good times, we often have faith in ourselves, believing it will endure. So why do we shift it during challenging times? Instead, let's channel that energy into a self-sufficient faith, unburdened by dependencies.
 
 Facing reality becomes simpler with this approach. They say faith can move mountains, which means seeking answers within and shedding the weight of self-created obstacles. Each individual possesses the ability to discern expectations from possibilities and find peace. Yet societal norms lure us into believing in miracles.
 
 While no one has complete control over life's challenges, we often seek external saviors. This mindset validates miracles and leaves us vulnerable to exploitation. To avoid this trap, have faith in your understanding and make decisions best suited for you.
 
 Miracles or not, nothing lasts forever. Believing in oneself and maintaining faith until the end ‚Äì now that's a true miracle.
