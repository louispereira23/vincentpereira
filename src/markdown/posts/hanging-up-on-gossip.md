Gossip is often referred to as the devil's telephone, and it's best to hang up. However, this is easier said than done. Gossip has been a part of human existence for ages, and life might seem dull without it. I admit that I have indulged in gossip from time to time, but I've tried hard to abstain.
 
 Although I can't claim complete success, knowing that I haven't gossiped provides a sense of satisfaction. Yet, one may unintentionally fall into the trap of adding value to a conversation that amounts to gossip. This typically occurs as a reflex action, without considering the potential harm caused by such conversations.
 
 To avoid gossiping, I have devised a simple method: refrain from discussing others in their absence, whether positively or negatively. If someone else brings up the topic, merely acknowledge the good aspects. Give this method a try; it may prove helpful.
