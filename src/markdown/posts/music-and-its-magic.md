"Music to my ears" is a statement often made when receiving pleasant news. The power of sound can either calm or excite our minds, depending on the genre chosen. It's hard to imagine life without music, as it transcends even religion in guiding our lives. Without music, life would be rather mundane.
 
 Don't mistake music for mere sound; it's the artistry in delivering those sounds. If there is no art involved, it becomes noise - quite different from music. However, one must consider that what may be music to one person could be noise to another; it's highly subjective. Nevertheless, when all elements harmonize, music stirs the soul.
 
 Make a habit of listening to music at least once a day, even if just for a few minutes. It will revitalize your mind. And of course, remember to thank the musicians.
