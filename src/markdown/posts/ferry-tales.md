Meet me at the 6 o'clock ferry' - such phrases were often heard during my college days. As islanders, Diwadkars had the luxury of meeting friends for a delightful, free fifteen-minute river cruise, where topics and plans were discussed since there was no other easier mode of communication.
 
 Recalling those days feels like a luxury I miss today. Although we still cross the ferry, the camaraderie has been lost due to the intrusion of mobile phones, resulting in an individualistic attitude on display. It may sound vague to call those fifteen minutes spent on the ferry with friends a stress buster, but it truly was. We would discuss various topics, or some would eagerly await meeting their prospective life partners. Worry would surround them if they missed that ferry since they had to wait until the next day to clear their anxiety.
 
 In those days, it was almost taboo to have a relationship before marriage, so the ferryboat ride served as a discreet meeting spot. A smile from two meters apart sufficed to keep the flame alive for the next day, eventually building long-term relationships.
 
 The best times were sometimes during bad moments for some commuters, such as when the ferry broke down. Back then, Diwar had only one ferry and repairs took hours, so an impromptu gathering was inevitable. It was more enjoyable in the evening on the Old Goa side as bars were within walking distance. Every hour added value as we listened to changes in tone and topics among revelers who occasionally burst into song. The happiest individuals were courting couples since no parents questioned their late arrival.
 
 Our ferryboat in those days not only ferried us to the other side but also set many on their lifelong journey together. So here's a thanks to that matchmaking machine.
