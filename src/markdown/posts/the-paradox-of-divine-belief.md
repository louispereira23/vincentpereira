God is humanity's greatest invention. It's hard to imagine life without this concept. Yet humans didn't stop at just one deity. They created many gods, influenced by their moods and egos. Every kingdom had its own deity, which the wealthy followed blindly, while the commoners were forced to do the same.
 
 Religion was, and still is, used as a tool to rule. Now there is a struggle for superiority among followers, while the gods are left to fend for themselves. The irony is that they haven't managed to divide Heaven or Hell.
 
 Followers comfort themselves by saying it's the path one chooses to reach the destination that matters, even though the destination remains the same. Here lies the confusion: which is the ideal path? What difference does it make to Heaven?
 
 Where does this path start? I pondered. The straightforward answer is that it begins here on Earth. And where does it end? Here on Earth itself.
 
 So it does matter to choose the right path to experience Heaven on Earth. It need not be religious, but it should be full of goodness.
 
 There is only one Heaven because one cannot split the Earth.
