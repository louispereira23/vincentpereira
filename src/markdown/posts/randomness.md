I must confess, I am somewhat inebriated while writing this, but I am determined to record my thoughts as they currently stand. Today, I experienced the power of unplanned events, which turned out to be one of my most memorable days. We often focus on planning to such an extent that it robs us of the unexpected, especially when it isn't about consequential matters.
 
 In this particular instance, we set out for one event but ended up somewhere else entirely, and had a fantastic time. I feel compelled to mention the name of the place, as it added a certain flavor to the experience: a restaurant called "Seven Short One Long." Admittedly, the name made little sense to me at first, but ultimately it proved worthy due to its culinary delights, enjoyable music, and the local brew Feni. The company of my friends only enhanced the experience.
 
 So, dear readers, when things don't go according to plan, don't be disheartened; instead, embrace randomness and give it a chance. You won't regret it.
