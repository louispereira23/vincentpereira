Undeniably, we are products of our society. The information we gather stems from what we hear, observe, read, or experience, resulting in a two-way flow. But is it possible to make this flow one-directional?
 
 This process aims to understand oneself from within, delving deep into the abstract. Although seemingly intangible, its presence is undeniable. This thought process represents an alternate way of thinking, best practiced in isolation rather than as a daily routine.
 
 It provides solace during distress â€“ the very distress that arises from being part of society. Yet, we cannot escape our societal roles.
 
 A quote comes to mind: "I am not what happened to me; I am what I choose to become."
