Life: A Reflection
 
 It is my aim to help alleviate the fear of death, a challenging endeavor. Life permeates everything, and to believe otherwise is foolish. This is the doctrine we've become accustomed to.
 
 I remain unconvinced, not confused, but rather baffled that others fail to grasp the reality that all living things must eventually fade away. While I don't advocate embracing death, it's perplexing how some insist on the notion of eternal life. How naive can we be?
 
 If only we could accept the value of life lies in its finiteness, how much more meaningful would our existence be? It merely requires a shift in perspective, at no cost, but with the courage to face the truth. As they say, practice makes perfect; embrace this thought and find bliss. 
 Death is a gift of LIFE .
