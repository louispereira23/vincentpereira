India's secular nature is not due to its minority, but rather its majority. The Hindu majority prevents the country from becoming a single-religion theocracy. Despite concerns about changes in India, it remains steadfast in its values because of this religious majority.
 
 In other countries with one dominant religion, many have become theocratic. Although India faces many problems, they don't stem from the majority wanting systemic change. Instead, these issues arise from fractured mandates in democratic elections.
 
 Without such divisions, no party could gain enough power to alter India's constitution significantly. Few people may try to change our country's ethos. But while the constitution may evolve over time, India will remain true to itself and maintain its core values of "Sab ke saath, Sab ka vikas".
