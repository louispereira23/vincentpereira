Enough - a word so casually uttered. Delve deeper, and one may uncover contrasting definitions of what is enough, or even more than enough. Life revolves around materialism, status, and fame - all encapsulated within the concept of 'enough.' Yet when applied, the meaning shifts. Many of us stumble into the trap of never knowing what is truly enough, leading to hatred and greed.
 
 To overcome this dilemma, one must reflect on their life and recognize the trap they are captured in. An effective method to detach oneself and gain perspective is to transcend beyond Earth. Our existence on this planet feels all-encompassing; even our age is dictated by its rotations and revolutions. But venturing beyond Earth reveals that our lifespan is minuscule compared to the universe's timeline.
 
 This realization redefines our understanding of 'enough,' allowing us to cherish life and smile at its fleeting nature. We can then rejoice in others' happiness and find contentment in imperfection. Life need not be perfect; it should be fulfilling. Embrace this transcendent thought process, and nothing will hold you back from rejoicing in the gift of life.
 
 For my sixty-fifth birthday, I bestow upon myself this delightful present.
