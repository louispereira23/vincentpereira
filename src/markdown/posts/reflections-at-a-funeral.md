I'd seen this face many a times but today it dawned on me that she is my great-grandmother on my mother's side. It brought home the fact that I owe my existence to this woman â€“ a sobering realization indeed.

 Gazing at the church, I pondered if my great-grandmother had walked this very path when things were starkly different. Being in our shared birthplace felt like an indulgence; connecting myself to several generations rooted here made me feel deeply native.
 
 Today reinforced that embracing one's roots creates a strong sense of belonging, something we often neglect but should cherish instead.
