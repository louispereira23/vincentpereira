As December ends, we anticipate the new year with resolutions born from our acknowledged flaws and hopes for improvement. We exchange 'Happy New Year' greetings in this spirit.
 
 In our digital age, mass-connecting has become effortless. Receiving hundreds of New Year wishes—and the obligation to respond—often reduces this tradition to a mechanical task, drawing quiet complaints.
 
 I once felt ashamed, catching myself grudgingly wishing someone happiness. This moment of self-awareness became pivotal—a call to align my words with genuine intent. Recognizing and working to overcome this human inconsistency is my resolution for 2024.
 
 A Happy New Year, indeed.
