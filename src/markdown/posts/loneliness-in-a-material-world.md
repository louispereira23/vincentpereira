Loneliness is a growing issue reaching almost epidemic levels. What causes this feeling? It's not simply being alone, as one can feel lonely even in a crowd. Loneliness stems from our thought processes and the beliefs we hold about ourselves.
 
 When people focus on exclusivity, believing they are important or superior due to wealth or status‚ they may isolate themselves. This self-imposed isolation can lead to loneliness if there's no one around to challenge their views or share experiences with them.
 
 It's crucial for individuals to recognize that they're part of the larger human tribe and should connect with others rather than seeking separation. There's nothing wrong with aspiring for wealth; however, it shouldn't create an exclusive mindset where accumulating possessions takes priority over forming relationships.
 
 Society often places celebrities on pedestals, leading to envy and jealousy among those who desire similar lifestyles. But it's essential to remember that material possessions have price tags but not intrinsic value. Feeling connected and fulfilled comes from understanding what truly matters in life – relationships, personal growth, and embracing our shared humanity.
