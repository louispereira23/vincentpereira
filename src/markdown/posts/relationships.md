For a thriving, contented relationship, it's crucial to accept the unvarnished truth. Often, we hear that relationships involve compromise and give-and-take, but rarely are we told how much to give or take in order to maintain a successful partnership.
 
 The notion of give-and-take trying to maintain balance can be misguided. A healthy relationship involves agreeing to disagree, while setting boundaries that respect one another's feelings even if full agreement isn't reached. This approach safeguards one's identity, as excessive compromise can erode self-respect and ultimately lead to the dissolution of the relationship.
 
 For a robust relationship, open-mindedness is essential. Recognizing what is right should take precedence over who is right.
 A relationship built solely on compromise lacks genuine connection.
 Remember you have one life. Make it worthwhile.
