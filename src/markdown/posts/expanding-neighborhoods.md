The definition of a neighborhood has changed, for the worse. Previously, neighbors existed within a square kilometer and we navigated all events, good or bad, within this boundary. This system fostered mutual understanding without disrupting personal peace.
 
 However, the advent of WhatsApp has blurred these borders. Unwanted information invades our homes uninvited, becoming an unwelcome norm. Recent examples include local disputes or priestly opinions that would previously remain unknown to us; now they consume unnecessary time in late-night discussions.
 
 It's essential to be selective about what you allow into your consciousness, unless you wish to spoil life's pleasant moments.
