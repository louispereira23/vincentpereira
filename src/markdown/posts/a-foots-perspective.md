I glanced at my feet,
 Wondering if they were truly mine.
 They seemed defiant, as if unwilling to admit they belonged to me.
 A quiet inquiry arose: do you have time for us?
 
 Their complaint was evident,
 For they are last in line.
 Lacking the pampering of your face,
 Would you notice your shortcomings if we ceased our duties?
 
 We carry you without complaint,
 Bleeding for no fault of our own.
 Tired at times, yet we ensure you reach your destination.
 
 The lesson is clear:
 Take time to notice yourself - the whole you.
 Embrace your body,
 Thank every part for their service.
 You'll find no reason to complain,
 And begin to love yourself,
 Starting with your feet.
