Growing up in the village of Diwar, my childhood was both interesting and challenging. As one of ten siblings who lost our parents at a young age, we lived together in our ancestral home and faced tough times without them.
 
 My school journey wasn't easy either. I often felt like a rebel and struggled with feeling different from other children. Even though we had plenty of food, laughter, and love at home, some things still seemed unfair to me - like not having proper uniforms.
 
 One incident stands out: when I was in 8th grade, a teacher pulled me by my ill-fitting shirt and made an insensitive comment about it being my father's shirt. This made me so angry that I stormed out of her French class and never returned until 10th grade. During those three years away from studying French, I spent much time outside school, lost in philosophical thoughts.
 
 I gave up on my academics, being rebellious and searching for answers. The eureka moment struck me when I recalled my father's expectations of me becoming a lawyer. This realization came during my routine monthly medical treatment at Goa Medical College. I picked up a cigarette from the GMC canteen (cigarettes were sold in the canteen at that time). Luckily, I got it for free as my friend was manning the cash counter.
 
 I went to the nearby park, now known as Mahavir Park, next to old GMC. I questioned myself: Why? Why not fulfill my father's expectations? From then on, my life's trajectory changed, and I completed my law degree, though I didn't pursue it to its logical conclusion.
 
 But here I am today, with no complaints about who I have become.
