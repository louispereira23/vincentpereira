We often mention the need to control our bodies, which may be true, but sometimes the mind enters overdrive when it realizes the body isn't meeting expectations - we call this sickness. At this point, we must train our minds not to think of extreme solutions, but instead allow our bodies the opportunity to activate all available options to return us to the right course.
 
 It's important to acknowledge that our bodies have built-in remedies for everyday ailments that don't require specialist intervention. This is not to undermine medical professionals, whose value is truly appreciated when we are in distress. However, we must also recognize that medicine is a profession, and like all professions, it involves financial considerations.
 
 The existence of more hospitals doesn't necessarily mean fewer patients; rather, for medical professionals to thrive, they must not only cure existing patients but also create new ones.
