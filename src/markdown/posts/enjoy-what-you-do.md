Enjoy what you do" is common advice for new ventures. However, it's important to distinguish between "enjoy" and "for enjoyment" in this context.
 
 Activities "for enjoyment" are hobbies, not profit-driven pursuits. Many ventures fail when entrepreneurs confuse these categories. Unlike hobbies, which have flexible time and cost constraints, businesses operate within strict parameters.
 
 When hobbies evolve into businesses, they demand a fundamental shift in approach. Business isn't for the risk-averse; every venture faces potential failure despite careful planning. Therefore, thorough preparation for setbacks is essential.
 
 In business, success often stems from intangible factors that aren't immediately apparent. Acknowledging these subtle influences is crucial in understanding a business's current position.
 In essence, if pursuing your passion isn't an option, find ways to appreciate your obligationsâ€”that's the core of business.
