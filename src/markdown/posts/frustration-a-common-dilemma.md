We all construct our ideal worlds, influenced by our expectations and desires. Often, we attempt to enforce these ideals on others to achieve our goals. However, when met with opposition, frustration arises, casting a gloomy outlook on the future. This is particularly common when the implementation of our ideals is dependent on others.
 
 It is essential to recognize that each of us has unique expectations aimed at improving our individual worlds. We take ownership of "our world" but it has to be "my way". This attitude proves to be impractical. At this point its crucial to recognise that one can improve the situation on focusing on things within one's control.
 
 Accept that you are ultimately responsible for your happiness. If necessary, adjust your perception and focus on living life on your terms within a smaller scope. The world is beautiful ‚Äì don't squander your time indulging in frustration.
