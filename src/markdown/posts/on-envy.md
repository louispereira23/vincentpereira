Refrain from fantasizing about others,
 For it breeds envy and tarnishes the admirer.
 Do not claim it is human nature to feel so,
 But rather acknowledge you feel this way because you are human.
 
 As humans, we possess options, yet often neglect to explore them.
 Embrace reality as it is and become an engaged participant.
 
 Cherish the treasure of your time,
 Utilize it wisely and strive to be true to yourself.
 Avoid the pretense of goodness, for it may harbor deceit.
 If being you is inherently good, then that is your character.
 
 To fantasize about another's life is only to depreciate your own.
