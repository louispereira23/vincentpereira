Democracy Needs Change
 
 Election time used to be exciting with canvassing starting a month in advance, loudspeakers announcing the upcoming date, and passionate slogans filling the air. Meetings at the main square were customary, engaging not only eligible voters but also younger generations who could gauge voter preferences based on meeting attendance. People eagerly voted for governance instead of rulers.
 
 However, this enthusiasm is now missing as people choose rulers and surrender their power. Democracy needs reforms to revitalize its process:
 
 1. Limit elected officials to two tenures (continuous or otherwise).
 2. Lower the voting age to sixteen.
 3. Implement primary and secondary voting where top two candidates in the primaries compete in the secondary round for majority approval, avoiding situations where someone wins with less than a majority.
 4.Once elected, ban defection to other parties, instead, only allow resignation accompanied by a forced five year break from political activities.
 
 Some may argue against these changes due to expenses involved; however, investing in democracy is just as crucial as investing in our defense budget for securing our nation's future.
