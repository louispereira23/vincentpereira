Society craves immediacy,
 Demanding swift conclusions.
 Fixated on binaries,
 Good or bad, happy or sad,
 Healthy or sick, pass or fail,
 Truth or lie.
 Yes or No.
 Such judgments lack distinction.
 
 We count one, two, three,
 Yet serenity lies between.
 Value resides between zero and one.
 
 Not telling the truth isn't lying 
 Ponder.
