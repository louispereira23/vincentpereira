We often focus on major breakthrough and overlook the smaller things in life, such as the kind gestures we receive from others. In my case, I am fortunate to have had nine siblings, six of whom live within close proximity. This allows us to exchange thoughtful gestures like sharing homemade delicacies.
 
 In a time when families are becoming more nuclear and there's less warmth in our surroundings, having siblings nearby is a true luxury. I wish for future generations to experience at least 50% of this closeness and connection that I enjoy with my family.
