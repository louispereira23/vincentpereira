Echoes of a Shared Past
 
 Photography prompts reminiscing,
 As I discovered when an childhood friend's group photo taken some years ago resurfaced.
 A snapshot bridging past and present.
 
 Once equal playmates,
 Now a subtle disparity lingers.
 We measure ourselves by achievements, seemingly distancing from cherished memories, as if the past held no value.
 What changed? Nothing monumental,
 Only our thoughts diverged, as some amassed more than others, altering perceptions, yet at our core, we remain unchanged.
 
 Thankful for the preserved memory,
 Two have since left this world.
 Eventually, the rest shall follow,
 And in the end, equality will be restored.
