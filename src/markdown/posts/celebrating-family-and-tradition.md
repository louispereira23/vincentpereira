As I was driving today to the house of my ancestors, Armacar Niwas, a wild thought excited me. I am going to get the house ready for my son's wedding. It made me think about the generations who lived in that house. It was so overwhelming to realise that most of the descendants, if not all, will be present in body or in thought. This feeling was beyond luxury.
 
 I felt indebted to the values passed on to us by our parents. Though short in time, I could vividly recall my father's saying â€“ 'Ektain Rawat'. He often said it in an inebriated state, as I am right now.
 
 Cheers to the values imbibed in us.
 
 Viva Armacars!
