Age, often considered a simple number, conceals its true influence on our abilities. Tasks manageable at 20 may become challenging at 60. We must acknowledge that age carries implications beyond mere digits.
 
 Growing older bestows wisdom and acceptance of age-related limitations. As more yesterdays accumulate than tomorrows, an unavoidable slowdown emerges.
 
 Our minds maintain youthful vigor while our bodies bear life's journey's marks. Nostalgia shades our perceptions, as diminishing physical capacities influence our view of the past.
 
 Embracing aging without regret is essential, but recognizing its changes is equally crucial, 
 Age is a just a number â€“ but be mindful that as this number adds the balance reduces.
 Enjoy life in a hurry. Celebrate your birth everyday and don't wait for the one day per year.
  
 For comfort answer this: How old would you be if you didn't know the day you were born?
