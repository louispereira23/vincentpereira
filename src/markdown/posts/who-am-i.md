Thought for Today:
 
 Ask yourself, "Who am I?" 
 As you strive to understand yourself,
 Competing with others loses meaning.
 Your focus becomes solely on being you.
 
 The challenge lies in self-discovery,
 For we're often shrouded in falsehood.
 Yet, beneath the layers, you exist,
 Unburdened by accolades and attachments,
 Free of anxiety and at peace within.
 
 Spend time with yourself; it's worthwhile.
