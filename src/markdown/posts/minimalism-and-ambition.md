The word "more" has become so fashionable that it nearly ridicules the concept of minimalism. With its unquenchable nature, one might question whether aspiring for more is a misguided pursuit. While I ponder this, I must admit that my answer may not be entirely conclusive.
 
 There is nothing inherently wrong with seeking more, provided that one keeps in mind the value of minimalism. Striking a balance between ambition and simplicity helps maintain one's identity and sanity. Solely chasing after more by aping without appetite can lead to greed, potentially sabotaging one's peace of mind.
 
 Minimalism need not imply scarcity; rather, it represents the precise amount needed for genuine contentment. Anything beyond that often serves as a means of seeking approval from society. This competitive mindset, focused on comparing oneself to others rather than personal growth, can result in restlessness.
 
 Let us give minimalism its due credit. After all, being a minimalist doesn't mean owning nothing; it means ensures that nothing owns you.
