Perfection is a pursuit and will remain so, though many of us strive to attain it in our endeavors. Keep in mind that perfection is a relative phenomenon, not an absolute one.
 
 One may satisfy their urge by deeming the outcome perfect, which is relative to one's feelings, but nothing can be absolutely perfect. It is rightly said that perfection is boring, as it halts progress, and life is essentially a work in progress.
 
 Let perfection be your pursuit, and progress will follow.
