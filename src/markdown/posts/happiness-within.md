Dependent happiness often involves comparing ourselves to others and focusing on external factors. While it's natural to care about our relationships and the well-being of loved ones, it's crucial to recognise the importance of personal happiness.
 
 Nowadays, society is fixated on the idea of being rich and famous. Most people don't think about the value of happiness.
 
 True happiness comes from within, and we must allocate time for self-care and independent joy. Remember that when we pass away, our world goes with us. Therefore, make an effort to experience genuine contentment by dedicating a portion of your life exclusively to yourself.
 
 That being said, once you share happiness with others, it magnifies. In return, partaking in others' happiness sustains it.
 
 Any endeavour one undertakes must please yourself. In other words, be selfish to be selfless.
