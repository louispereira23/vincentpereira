From time to time, I find myself reminiscing about particular incidents, and I felt the urge to record one such memory. My academic journey from high school to earning two degrees was rather challenging, so much so that I nearly dropped out in the tenth grade. This wasn't due to a lack of intelligence, but rather a lack of enthusiasm and focus. Nonetheless, I carried on.
 
 One day, I resolved to reevaluate my life. I purchased a cigarette pack at the GMC canteen and sat in the nearby park, then known as the children's park. As the fresh air quickened my cigarette's burn, I pondered my future without pressure. This introspection brought to mind my father's hopes for me - to become a lawyer. It was a sudden realisation that put me back on course.
 
 Though unable to attend daily classes, I compensated by studying intensely in the college library a month before exams. This pattern persisted until I completed law school. The flashback inspiring this writing took place during my first year of law exams.
 
 Frequent library visits at law college familiarized me with college staff, whose casual demeanor influenced me during exams and made me overly relaxed. After completing all my papers, I awaited the results. To my dismay, the results indicated me , Absent and while the one ahead of me passed. I knew the surrounding benches were empty; therefore, it must have been me who occupied his seat.
 Proving this was difficult since all records showed he had answered.
 
 The only solution was obtaining a declaration from the actual absentee student and having it endorsed by the college. Thus, I tracked him down to his bank job in Bicholim. Upon asking about him, everyone shouted his name: "Parsekar hanga yo!" ; They were all aware of this mix-up.
 
 He kindly signed the declaration without hesitation and advised me to be cautious since things could have been worse.
 
 Since then, I've attempted not to be too casual in my endeavors â€“ though admittedly, I am still only halfway there.
