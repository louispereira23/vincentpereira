My Diary
 
 For nearly a decade, I've recorded my experiences, expectations, and candid thoughts based on the situations and surroundings I've encountered.
 
 Reviewing these entries, I marvel at the sheer volume and diversity of topics, despite some repetition and contradictions. This only reinforces that these writings are unfiltered reflections of my daily life.
 
 Initially, organizing these notes wasn't a priority. However, a fortunate intuition and access to my son Louis's AudioPen app helped transform these scattered musings into coherent text. I am truly grateful for this invaluable tool.
 
 These observations aim not to impress or persuade others without merit but to satisfy my curiosity. A random reading may serve a purpose; thus, I wish to share my thoughts with the ARMACARS young family members, showing them that life offers more than what's visible on the surface.
 
 Additionally, I want to share these reflections with friends who have tolerated my intrusion through my postings and discussions of such observations over time.
 
 Before printing these entries, I felt the need to reflect on my experiences and recall the moments that inspired them. This exercise confirmed that my life thus far at sixty-six has been akin to a roller coaster - sometimes up, sometimes down - but at no point have I regretted my existence. I strongly believe that every day is a new day, not a continuation of yesterday, and I remain excited to discover what tomorrow holds for me.
 
 I express my heartfelt gratitude to my wife, Ruby, and my children, Golda and Louis. I sincerely thank them for allowing me to be myself.
