I've frequently employed the phrase 'time is money,' primarily because we value it with money. I have been uttering this phrase many times. However, I eventually realized the inadequacy of using 'money' to represent time's worth.
 
 Indeed, time surpasses the value of money; it is irreplaceable and cannot be bought. The notion that we waste time is a misconception; we always utilize it in some manner or another. We merely claim to have wasted time when we cannot measure its return in material terms, forgetting that time's true worth is incalculable.
 
 The major distinction between money and time lies in our awareness of their quantities. We can know how much money we possess, but we are uncertain about our remaining time.
 Earning money is not inherently problematic; just ensure that you don't become so captivated by it that you equate it with precious time.
