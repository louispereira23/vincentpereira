Ah, the Joys of Youth
 
 Few would contest the notion that youth is a delightful period in one's life. This is primarily due to the unburdened and autonomous nature of a young mind. However, as we age, our minds become trained in seriousness, replacing innocence with contemplation.
 
 In this state, vulnerability emerges, making one susceptible to radical influences. Individuals may feel compelled to join a particular group or adopt specific beliefs. Concepts such as God are propagated by the educated, leading to the identification of others by race or religion. Consequently, segregation takes root and an unspoken assertion arises: "My God is superior to yours." (here I must mention that education without secular mindset is ignorance.)
 
 This mindset fosters hypocrisy, ultimately resulting in the belief that life is a struggle.
 
 To rediscover the joy and playfulness of youth, cleanse your mind and resist indoctrination. Begin anew, without opinions or judgments from the past. Give it a try â€“ you may not be able to articulate the difference, but you will certainly experience it. 
 Stay young.
