What's your name? This question seems to appear less frequently as we age. Do you remember when young the pride in answering this query, chest puffed out, declaring your name?
 
 As we grow older, it may feel rude to ask someone their name directly. Instead, we opt for the more polite, "May I know your good name?" But why the change?
 
 It's quite simple: one expects to be recognized. "Don't you know me?" If not, it's your responsibility to humbly inquire.
 
 This isn't merely about names or identity; it's about who we are beyond our monikers. Consider this: who would you be without a name? It's a perplexing thought.
 
 You might realize that you'd still be yourself but without identification. Thus, the importance of our names becomes clear.
 
 However, as time passes, our names alone may feel insufficient. We begin to focus on prefix and suffix such as qualifications, achievements, wealth, and so forth. We expect recognition through these additions rather than just our names.
 
 This mindset warrants reconsideration. Remember that the most beautiful sound one is attracted to is their name. Forget the prefixes /suffixes and strive to be worthy of being directly asked or called by your name.
