Weddings in the 1970s were quite remarkable. During that time, everyone eagerly anticipated a local wedding. Preparations would begin one to two weeks before the event, creating an atmosphere filled with excitement and music.
 
 A locally-made shamiana with delightful flower arrangements was essential, and the celebration would last from 10 PM until 6 AM. Snacks, soft drinks, beer, and local fusion cuisine were staples at these weddings.
 
 However, there were occasional disputes within families over minor etiquette lapses. As the 1980s approached, I found myself serving as master of ceremonies for several weddings. Although my attire wasn't quite what it is today, my speaking abilities secured me the role. Over four to five years, I must have officiated at about 25 weddings, or perhaps more.
 
 As master of ceremonies, I had control over various aspects of the event, such as song selection, dance styles, and even bar service. Though announcing 'The bar is closed' may sound embarrassing nowadays, it was part of the package.
 
 An amusing custom back then was the tag dance. If a guest desired a particular partner who refused to dance, they could request a tag dance. This impromptu dance allowed anyone to join in and tag their desired partner. While some may have resisted this tradition, it was devised because most girls were very selective and would sometimes refuse to dance casually, saying 'I am engaged,' leaving the poor boy to walk back dejected.
 
 All this was part of the charm of weddings during those times. Nowadays, celebrations wrap up by 10 PM, but those weddings remain unforgettable parties.
