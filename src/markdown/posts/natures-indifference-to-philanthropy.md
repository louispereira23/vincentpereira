Philanthropy, a distinctly human concept, seeks to benefit society. We frequently hear about climate change and experts often provide suggestions through conferences and PowerPoint presentations. While we observe alterations in nature's patterns, many attribute these changes to human behavior and call for adjustments. However, I believe this shift occurs due to nature's inherent laws.
 
 Consider the fact that planet Earth was once in an ice age; what brought about the current state are its natural laws. This suggests that nature is indifferent to our actions, tending to itself. Our responsibility lies in managing our lives effectively. Nature's primary concerns involve the growth, procreation, demise, and decay of its inhabitants. Nothing more, nothing less.
