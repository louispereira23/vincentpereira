The seventies marked an awakening in my life. As an adolescent, my curiosity peaked, and I sought the purpose of my existence. This period intensified due to circumstances beyond my control, driving me to find stability within and around me.
 
 This decade continued the hippie culture of the sixties. The saffron robes of Bhagwan Rajneesh's followers, later known as OSHO, were visible everywhere. My curiosity led me to explore Rajneesh's teachings while balancing practicality and fantasy. I knew that ultimately, I needed to focus on work and provide food for the table. However, this didn't deter me from learning about Rajneesh and his predominantly foreign following. I pondered why these seemingly wealthy individuals sought answers in India.
 
 I purchased some of his books from flea markets in Anjuna and later acquired cassettes when Walkmans became popular. Some of his quotes profoundly influenced my life and pursuit of self-understanding:
 - Darkness is merely the absence of light; light a candle, and you will see the light coming in but not the darkness going out.
 - To know you don't know is knowledge; not to know you don't know is ignorance. Knowledge isn't knowing everything but knowing that you don't know.
 - Don't worry about life after death; ensure you're living before death.
 - Don't be a follower; be a student. Followers obey instructions, while students discover the truth.
 
 These quotes, though perhaps not exact, provided me with a sense of comfort within myself and my surroundings.
