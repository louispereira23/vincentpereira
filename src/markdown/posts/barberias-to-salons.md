The term 'barberia' has evolved into 'salon,' and with it, the entire trade has transformed. Initially, barberias were masculine spaces, frequented solely by men for haircuts or shaves. They were monopolized by specific castes and passed down through generations, resulting in highly skilled craftsmen called 'malle' in Konkani.
 
 The atmosphere at a barber's shop was unique. Visiting the barber was not only for grooming services but also to catch up on village news. Barbers had a knack for securing their customers' agreement, perhaps due to the sharp razor or scissor sounds. Disagreements were rare; there was either silence or support for the barber's views.
 
 Today's salons differ greatly; they are unisex and offer a wider range of services with various hairstylists. Upon arrival, clients choose from different massages and treatments, while hairstylists often become salespeople promoting beauty products. One is careful not to disappoint them as one's future appearance lies in their hands.
 
 In contrast, at the barberia, one could simply request a haircut or shave without much fuss. Options were limited to military cuts or normal ones. Occasionally, one would be at the mercy of an apprentice. In such cases, you might hear the common term 'hampailo,' which referred to a botched haircut.
 
 These memories remain vivid as I recall being a victim of an apprentice myself.
