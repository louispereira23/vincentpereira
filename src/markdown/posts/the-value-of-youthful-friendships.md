After attending an eighteenth birthday party, I was amazed by the raw camaraderie among the young people there. A question came to my mind: how many of them would remember this event when they become senior citizens?
 
 I started recalling my own younger days. To my surprise, I could remember many gatherings in great detail. This led me to conclude that true friendships are often formed when we are young and yet to blossom.
 
 Once you blossom, your success attracts many, but they come and go with the tide. It's important to differentiate between friends and acquaintances. However, there are exceptions to this rule, as some acquaintances might become close friends or even life partners.
 
 That being said, the most genuine friendships are often formed during our twenties. Beyond that, people tend to recognize you for what you are rather than who you are.
 
 Hold on to the friendships from your youth; they are priceless. Meet your old friends with a warm hug whenever possible, and don't reduce these friendships to merely sending emojis.
