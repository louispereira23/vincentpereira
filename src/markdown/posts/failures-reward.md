In particular, this pertains to my academic setbacks, as I don't believe in the idea of failure making one a loser. However, you do lose an academic year, and thus are held back. In my case, I lost two years – one in the tenth grade and another in the twelfth. During these years, I learned more than what I would have gained academically. I hadn't chosen to fail, but my rebellious nature led to a future influenced by random consequences.
 
 One reward emerged from my efforts, and it wasn't merely by chance. Having been delayed by two years, and as my college days lacked daily attendance since I had to work at my shop situated between the bus stand and the college, I had the opportunity to observe students commuting to college. While leaning on my shop's doorframe, I noticed a lively girl walking towards the college. Curious about her class and college affiliation, I visited the canteen and discovered she was in the thirteenth class, one year junior to me at our college. I got myself introduced through a common friend (Lizy) and came to know her name in the year 1981.
 
 At that moment, I felt grateful for having failed twice; otherwise, I might have missed her entirely. Though I felt I was punching above my weight, it didn't deter me.
 
 Thus began my pursuit. As an irregular college attendee, the best opportunity arose when I opted for a National Service Scheme (NSS) camp in 1982.
 
 Learning she would attend as an NSS volunteer, I eagerly enrolled. Confident in my ability to impress her, I shared my feelings with my friend Ivo at a bar (George Bar) near our meeting point before departure.
 
 My first plan of action was to identify potential rivals. Once we arrived at our destination, I decided to sponsor drinks for them to better understand their intentions. Eventually running out of money, I returned home to gather what little funds I could. Fortunately, Prakash secured a deal that provided me with 250 rupees.
 
 Eager to return before dusk and capitalize on my opportunity, my friend Stanley offered his Jawa bike, and off we went to Keri next to Doda Marg. Despite getting lost briefly, we made it back.
 
 Armed with money, I treated the other contenders one last time, making my intentions clear with a firm request for them to keep their distance. They obliged, and my path was clear. I'm grateful for my failures because that young girl is now a grandmother – yes, my wife.
 Today she turned a senior citizen.

 A union of forty-two years. I am stopping short of saying "I am what I am because of her" only because I don't want to blame her.
 That being said, I don't know how to thank her.
