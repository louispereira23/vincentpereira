Many individuals fall into the trap of believing their belongings define them, subsequently identifying themselves as part of their possessions. This mindset gives rise to an identity crisis simply because once wealth is drained you also lose your character proportionately.
 
 So, who are you? Do riches make you who you are, or do you create your wealth? The answer is quite simple. If you are attached to material items, they shape your identity; conversely, if you are detached, it is you who creates your wealth. Who you are matters more then what you are.
 Detachment fosters a sense of sanity
