Lately, I've received comforting words about being a senior citizen. While it has its merits, I refuse to deny my aging reality.
 
 As a senior, I embrace unbounded freedom, akin to a vagabond. Busyness no longer defines my worth, and I've freed myself from most responsibilities without guilt. At times, I relish the solitude of silence.
 
 I've savored the sweet and sour experiences of youth. Reflecting on a song lyric that resonates with me: If there was a well of youth, I wouldn't take a sip, and that's the truth.
 
 Feeling content with fulfilling my duties well, I recall moments once aspired for in the future. Realizing that the desired future is now, I don't plan to halt my journey but will pause to appreciate my accomplishments. 
 
 With humility and no regrets, I stand ready to pack my bags for the next to come.
