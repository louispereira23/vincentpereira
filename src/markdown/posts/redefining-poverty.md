In today's world, the focus on alleviating poverty often revolves around material poverty. We tend to think of poverty mostly as a lack of food, shelter, and clothing, and leaders and religious figures emphasize serving the poor as a noble act. However, I must ask: what makes one feel wealthy enough to serve the poor? If we only view poverty as material, then perhaps having extra money qualifies us to help.
 
 But there is more to poverty than material circumstances; lack of attitudes such as gratitude, integrity, and equality contributes to the poverty of mindset. Some people may have enough but still feel poor, or their concern for others' well-being diminishes if someone else has more. This mindset must also be addressed.
 
 The notion of poverty extends beyond materialism. It isn't solely about financial aid or empathy for those with less; sometimes, those we deem "poor" possess a richer attitude towards life than their wealthier counterparts. We must recognize that we are all impoverished in our own ways.
