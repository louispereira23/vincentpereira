Why the haste for tomorrow,
 When today has yet to conclude?
 Still, we lament,
 Life is brief.
 
 Regardless of our presence, tomorrow approaches.
 Today offers ample time if one observes their surroundings.
 A recent encounter sparked this reflection:
 A middle-aged man sat alone, striking stones together, delighting in their resonance.
 
 I hesitate to label him a beggar,
 For who am I to categorize others?
 If I must assign a title,
 Let it be "teacher,"
 For he imparted wisdom upon me.
 
 He bore no regret,
 Seemingly content with life's trajectory.
 Almost telling me you are not here cause i have taken that space .
 
 Our interdependence is undeniable;
 No one person holds less or more significance.
