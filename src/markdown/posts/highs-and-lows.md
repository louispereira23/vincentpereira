Cherish Life
 A sudden urge to appreciate life, often overlooked, arises within me.
 It's clear that life is a pendulum,
 Swinging between highs and lows.
 Nothing endures eternally, neither peaks nor valleys,
 Yet the valleys weigh heavier than the elation of peaks.
 
 To truly cherish life, we must embrace the highs doubly so, counterbalancing the lows ahead.
 Today is such a day for me,
 And I'm wholeheartedly reveling in its amplified joys.
