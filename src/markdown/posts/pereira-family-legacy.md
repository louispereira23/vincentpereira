"Knock! Knock!
 For Your Twenty-Two Great-Great-Grandchildren
 
 The Legacy of Luis Francisco Pereira
 Luis Francisco Pereira, an entrepreneur and your great-great-grandfather, journeyed from Succor to Diwar Island in the early 19th century. Although I regret not knowing your great-great-grandmother's name, she likely found Diwar's beauty irresistible.
 
 Their granddaughter, Isabel Cristalina Pereira, shared stories of walking with her grandmother between Diwar and Succor over Chorao's hills. They'd stay overnight before returning with provisions from relatives.
 
 Luis Francisco established a tavern at Diwar; its structure still stands at Toleacho Bandh (meaning "embankment of a pond"). He traveled to Succor weekly for supplies but later obtained a house from his father's employer to expand his business on the island. This led to the family's relocation to what is now Armacar Niwas.
 
 Luis had one son, João Caitano Pereira. Luis passed away young, and João chose a seafaring career. During a trip home, he smuggled a gun, earning him the nickname "Armacar" (Konkani for "gun possession"), which has been proudly inherited since.
 
 João married Ana Maria Pascoal and had two children: Luis Antonio and Cristaline Isabel Pereira.
 João, too, died young aboard ship. Thanks to the intervention of kind souls, a burial at sea was avoided, and he was laid to rest at the nearest European port.
 
 A fortnight later, the family received a telegram in Portuguese, revealing the tragic news of João Caitan's death from cholera and his land burial. This tale was recounted by his daughter, Cristalin, then around fifteen, and her brother Luis Antonio Pereira, a mere five years old.
 
 Luis Antonio harbored one lingering regret: not knowing his father's final resting place. He would often speculate about European countries and yearned to visit them for closure. Sadly, it never came to pass.
 
 Luis Antonio married Maria Antonia (Alor), and they were blessed with ten children—one of whom is your parent.
 
 And thus unfolds the story of a house called Armacar Niwas.
 Whenever time permits,
 COME HOME."
