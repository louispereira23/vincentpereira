Save for the Rainy Days
 
 Upon hearing this phrase, one might instinctively brace for difficult times ahead. However, I have learned the art of enjoying the rain.
 
 Why vilify rain, which is often associated with prosperity? Granted, the saying has become popular.
 While I'm not against saving, as it does give one a sense of stability, it shouldn't come at the expense of relishing a sunny day. We must remember that the present we are in was once envisaged as our future.
 
 It's worth noting that the concept of saving is a modern invention. In earlier times, there were no banks, stocks, or insurance - practically nothing. People were foragers and didn't even hoard food, yet they persevered.
 
 In contrast, many contemporary individuals are so preoccupied with saving that they opt to live miserly only to pass away wealthy. I frequently remind my friends that what you earn isn't truly yours, but what you spend is.
 
 So enjoy your sunny days and be wise enough to spend.
 Remember, it's one life, it's your life - make it worthwhile.
