          <p>Recalling feelings from fifty years ago is no easy task, yet some memories remain as vivid as if they occurred today. I distinctly remember being in the hospital (Goa Medical College, old building) on October 7th, 1973, when my father passed away. Today marks half a century since that fateful day, but one thing that eludes me is how I ended up there to be with my father. Despite my best efforts, I cannot recall a single instance leading up to that moment. This only reinforces the notion that I was not myself at the time.</p>
<p> One memory that remains fresh is the sound of a knock on the door, which I desperately hoped would never come. With my father&#39;s condition precarious, a late-night knock seemed like an ominous confirmation of his passing. My father had instructed me to sleep at Uncle Ciriac&#39;s house since he felt better; our brother Joe and Joe Aguiar stayed with him. Although I left reluctantly, I dreaded that knock.</p>
<p> When it came, I knew the outcome. Bravely accepting it, the child within me cried. The realization of ten of us being orphaned - with me being young at fourteen and six siblings behind me - was hard to believe.</p>
<p> The echo of my cry resonates even now. I remember where I sat and the comforting hug of a young lady from Diwar, whose presence at such an early hour remains a mystery. She was the wife of a butcher named Mohamad and tried to console me with her tears falling onto my hand while uttering, &quot;Allah knows what&#39;s right.&quot;</p>
<p> Today, fifty years may have passed, but it feels like yesterday. In the same breath, I am astounded by our resilience, clearly displayed in what we have become today.</p>
<p> This date has added yet another dimension to my life as I am celebrating my granddaughter Maya&#39;s birthday. Indeed, I am a proud Xapai. This is called destiny.</p>
