          <p>I often reflect on my youthful experiences to navigate my present, particularly when faced with unwarranted anxieties. One of them is fear. Fear, as they say, is only as deep as you think. This adage seems perfect for warding off negative thoughts, yet fear can still linger.</p>
<p> At this point, I remember my childhood adventures - simple acts like going fishing early morning, barefoot in the dark, amidst thick vegetation without worrying about snake bites or other calamities. It appears that fear didn&#39;t exist then because I was focused on reaching my destination in a timely manner. Thus, I practice a similar attitude to dispel fear by concentrating on my objectives and moving forward.</p>
<p> When you&#39;re focused and passionate about reaching your goal, fear loses its grip. Ultimately, you&#39;ll realize there&#39;s no such thing as fear itself; it&#39;s merely the fear of fear that keeps you stagnant. Fear doesn&#39;t exist; it&#39;s created.</p>
