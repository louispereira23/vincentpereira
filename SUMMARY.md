# CSV Import Feature Summary

We've successfully implemented a CSV import feature for your static blog site. This feature allows you to bulk import multiple blog posts from a CSV file, making it much easier to migrate content or add multiple posts at once.

## What We've Created

1. **Import Script**: A Node.js script (`import-posts.js`) that reads a CSV file and converts each row into a markdown blog post.

2. **Sample CSV Template**: A template file (`simple-posts.csv`) showing the expected format for your CSV data.

3. **Documentation**: Detailed instructions in `CSV-IMPORT-README.md` explaining how to use the feature.

4. **NPM Script**: Added an `import` script to package.json for easy execution.

## How to Use It

1. Create a CSV file with your blog posts following this format:
   - `title` (required): The title of your blog post
   - `date` (optional): Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - `excerpt` (optional): A brief summary of the post
   - `topics` (optional): Comma-separated list of topics/tags
   - `content` (required): The full content of your post in Markdown format

2. Run the import script:
   ```bash
   npm run import path/to/your/posts.csv
   ```

3. Rebuild your site to see the changes:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Features

- Automatically generates slugs from post titles
- Calculates reading time based on content length
- Properly formats dates for display
- Handles topics/tags for filtering
- Provides detailed error messages for troubleshooting

## Example

We've successfully tested the import with a simple CSV file containing two test posts, which were correctly imported and displayed on the site with proper formatting, topics, and filtering capabilities.

## Next Steps

You can now use this feature to bulk import your existing blog posts. If you encounter any issues with complex CSV formatting, you may need to:

1. Ensure quotes are properly escaped in your CSV
2. Split very large CSV files into smaller chunks
3. Manually fix any posts that have parsing issues

For very complex content with special characters, you might find it easier to import a basic version and then edit the generated markdown files directly.
