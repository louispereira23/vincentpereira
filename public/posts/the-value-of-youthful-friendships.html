          <p>After attending an eighteenth birthday party, I was amazed by the raw camaraderie among the young people there. A question came to my mind: how many of them would remember this event when they become senior citizens?</p>
<p> I started recalling my own younger days. To my surprise, I could remember many gatherings in great detail. This led me to conclude that true friendships are often formed when we are young and yet to blossom.</p>
<p> Once you blossom, your success attracts many, but they come and go with the tide. It&#39;s important to differentiate between friends and acquaintances. However, there are exceptions to this rule, as some acquaintances might become close friends or even life partners.</p>
<p> That being said, the most genuine friendships are often formed during our twenties. Beyond that, people tend to recognize you for what you are rather than who you are.</p>
<p> Hold on to the friendships from your youth; they are priceless. Meet your old friends with a warm hug whenever possible, and don&#39;t reduce these friendships to merely sending emojis.</p>
