          <p>The primary source of belief in the supernatural stems from an insecurity we have nurtured: religion, a human-made concept. What is this insecurity? The answer lies in death.</p>
<p> Naturally, all living beings possess inherent traits for survival, striving to any extent to achieve it. In other words, it is an animal world of survival. However, as humans, we differentiate ourselves from other beings due to our rational approach. To coexist harmoniously, we developed religion.</p>
<p> Today, religion serves as a means to evade death and even suggests that life is immortal if one adheres to its teachings. This assurance of life after death can be better or worse, depending on how one lives their first life. Consequently, followers are often left confused, desiring heaven but unwilling to die on earth.</p>
<p> Hence, my advice is not to worry about life after death; live while you are alive instead of merely surviving. The debate surrounding God&#39;s existence remains open; one is free to choose their deity based on personal comfort. As long as your beliefs help you accept life&#39;s finiteness and encourage making the best of your time on earth.</p>
<p> Also, it&#39;s worth pondering â€“ if life was eternal, would the notion of a deity exist?</p>
