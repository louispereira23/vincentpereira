          <p>I&#39;ve observed how my feelings fluctuate based on varying circumstances. For instance, I endured a dreadful drive in Panjim yesterday. It took one hour for me to cover just five kilometers. As usual complaining about the incompetence of the officials was stressful. While they seemed to revel in it, I was the one punishing myself.</p>
<p> On the contrary, today&#39;s early morning&#39;s journey back to Panjim, to take part for an EV Rally was delightful. Despite traveling on same road as yesterday (minus the jam), listening to soothing music enhanced my travel experience and sparked some introspection. Had I listened to music yesterday the outcome would have been different.</p>
<p> We often merely anticipate life&#39;s best offerings rather than actively seeking them.</p>
<p> This contrast between yesterday and today illustrates that difference: expecting versus pursuing life&#39;s rewards. Yesterday was about expectation; today emphasized pursuit. The key is not simply to expect but also strive for life&#39;s best, it puts you in control.</p>
