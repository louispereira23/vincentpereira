          <p>My first trip outside Goa was to Bombay, now Mumbai, in the late 70s. My uncle Cruz, visiting from Kuwait, invited me to join him and his family. Eagerly, I accepted. We traveled by bus, which back then lacked air conditioning and had rattling windows that made sleep elusive. The journey took around 14 hours due to the steep ghats.</p>
<p> We arrived in Bombay early the next morning. The city&#39;s stench was overwhelming, a stark contrast to my village life. During my stay, I marveled at the Gothic architecture and enjoyed the less crowded atmosphere compared to today&#39;s bustling metropolis. However, I did not use the railwaysâ€”a wise decision considering my inability to cope with such chaos.</p>
<p> After a week, I boarded a steamer for my return journey. Unprepared, I brought only cigarettes and no bedding or blankets for the night. The daytime voyage was pleasant; passengers mingled and enjoyed camaraderie during our 24-hour journey. At night, I won one hundred rupees playing housie and treated myself to a beer.</p>
<p> The cold night forced me to stay close to the engine room where I consumed most of my cigarette pack. As we approached Goa&#39;s coast from the Arabian Sea, the sight of pine trees evoked a sense of belonging. That memorable trip remains close to my heart.</p>
