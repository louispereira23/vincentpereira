          <p>Often, I hear the sentiment, primarily from Goans, that we genuinely miss the olden days. To some extent, we do long for those times, but why has this become a central topic nowadays? Upon reflection, I&#39;d like to ask if you miss the old mud roads, life without electricity, unhygienic pig toilets, cooking on firewood, walking long distances, or lacking a telephone for communication. Numerous aspects have improved since our youth, and we&#39;ve played a part in these advancements.</p>
<p> Yes, there are always trade-offs and changes in life; however, it&#39;s time we embrace the remaining goodness of our land. As things continue to change and may not meet our expectations or desires, we must focus on understanding why people are compelled to adapt. People face various compulsions and must make choices based on necessity rather than preference.</p>
<p> While we&#39;ve progressed significantly and may reminisce about the past or want to watch our neighbors climb coconut trees as we relax nearby our swimming pool , we must remember that everyone has aspirations. Although we often complain about government actions, it&#39;s important to note that the government isn&#39;t a separate entity. We, the people, shape our circumstances; thus, if the majority is discontent with their lifestyle, they will seek comfort whichever way possible.
 To be in peace with oneself just imagine what would be your choice if faced with such circumstances.</p>
