          <p>Destiny, as explained, refers to events beyond our control. I find solace in this concept, as it allows me to outsource my anxiety to the power of randomness, believing that I am not entirely in control of any outcome, even if it means a 0.1% chance of an unexpected result.</p>
<p> Often, I have passionately defended this notion against friends who argue that our destiny lies in our own hands. Their perspective may seem sensible when they suggest that we must put forth effort to shape our desired destination; otherwise, it is akin to leaping into the sea without learning to swim. It can be challenging to counter such observations without falling into their trap.</p>
<p> However, I maintain that destiny does not equate to irrational beliefs. In fact, acknowledging destiny enables one to prepare thoroughly for any foreseeable eventuality while simultaneously accepting that unforeseen circumstances may occur.
 Ultimately I am convinced that my being is determined by time. How long, no one knows.</p>
