          <p>I glanced at my feet,
 Wondering if they were truly mine.
 They seemed defiant, as if unwilling to admit they belonged to me.
 A quiet inquiry arose: do you have time for us?</p>
<p> Their complaint was evident,
 For they are last in line.
 Lacking the pampering of your face,
 Would you notice your shortcomings if we ceased our duties?</p>
<p> We carry you without complaint,
 Bleeding for no fault of our own.
 Tired at times, yet we ensure you reach your destination.</p>
<p> The lesson is clear:
 Take time to notice yourself - the whole you.
 Embrace your body,
 Thank every part for their service.
 You&#39;ll find no reason to complain,
 And begin to love yourself,
 Starting with your feet.</p>
