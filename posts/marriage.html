          <p>Getting married is not an achievement; sustaining a marriage for a lifetime is, especially in today&#39;s environment. Admittedly, aligning two minds for a lifetime is no easy task. However, such an admission rarely comes to light before the marriage, as it is often portrayed as &quot;made in heaven.&quot; To me, this notion seems illogical unless heaven is as good as marriage. Then, at times one might wonder where hell resides.</p>
<p> Marriage is a worthy endeavor only if both parties accept that it comes with an unknown package and unforeseen challenges to overcome, bound by love rather than law. Respect for one another should supersede all else; with a respectful mindset, true love can flourish while mere infatuation fades. </p>
<p> Love at first sight moments do exist, but it is crucial to remember that sight is not constant.</p>
<p> Despite conflicts there are lasting partnerships not because they are made in heaven but could be attributed to one or both partners being divinely crafted.</p>
<p> A happy marriage is always a work in progress.</p>
