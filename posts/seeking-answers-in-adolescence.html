          <p>The seventies marked an awakening in my life. As an adolescent, my curiosity peaked, and I sought the purpose of my existence. This period intensified due to circumstances beyond my control, driving me to find stability within and around me.</p>
<p> This decade continued the hippie culture of the sixties. The saffron robes of Bhagwan Rajneesh&#39;s followers, later known as OSHO, were visible everywhere. My curiosity led me to explore Rajneesh&#39;s teachings while balancing practicality and fantasy. I knew that ultimately, I needed to focus on work and provide food for the table. However, this didn&#39;t deter me from learning about Rajneesh and his predominantly foreign following. I pondered why these seemingly wealthy individuals sought answers in India.</p>
<p> I purchased some of his books from flea markets in Anjuna and later acquired cassettes when Walkmans became popular. Some of his quotes profoundly influenced my life and pursuit of self-understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Darkness is merely the absence of light; light a candle, and you will see the light coming in but not the darkness going out.</li>
<li>To know you don&#39;t know is knowledge; not to know you don&#39;t know is ignorance. Knowledge isn&#39;t knowing everything but knowing that you don&#39;t know.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t worry about life after death; ensure you&#39;re living before death.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t be a follower; be a student. Followers obey instructions, while students discover the truth.</li>
</ul>
<p> These quotes, though perhaps not exact, provided me with a sense of comfort within myself and my surroundings.</p>
