          <p>Xapai,
 The title I opted for; instead of grandpa 
 Now sounds even sweeter when my granddaughter Maya
 Calls me by it.
 Sixty one years to earn this title,
 Probably nature, in its wisdom, chose the perfect moment.</p>
<p> I feel truly blessed by my granddaughter, for she has invigorated my life.
 It is often said that to feel different, one must awaken the child within. This is precisely what occurs each time Maya is with me; the child inside me stirs. However, I also envision her journey through a long life ahead. Intelligent and already conscious of her appearance, she desires to be well-groomed and often affirms her own beauty.</p>
<p> I know she will perceive life differently than I did, as her future lies in an advanced world. My hope is that she adheres to worthy values, and perhaps some parts from my writing will aid her in achieving this.</p>
