          <p>Maka zai tench kortolom&#39; - a phrase often uttered by my father, Luis Antonio, whose fiftieth death anniversary approaches on October 7, 2023. My dad lived life on his terms, as the Konkani phrase suggests. A self-made man, he passed away at forty-eight. I feel his life was like an incomplete journey, but I surrender to my belief that time is the ultimate ruler of our lives.</p>
<p> Yet, I sometimes question my own approach to life. How much of it is truly on my terms, and how sacred should I hold that notion? My life isn&#39;t entirely on my terms, and rightly so. Terms need not be unyielding; they can bend for a better outcome. I wish my father had considered this option and listened to my mother, who passed away just over a year before him, leaving us ten children orphaned - a reality we&#39;ve faced for fifty years come October 7, 2023.</p>
<p> On this day, we plan to release a book detailing our experiences and journey thus far: &#39;The Armacars: Ten Siblings, One Story.&#39;</p>
