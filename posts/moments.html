          <p>I recently watched a Charlie Chaplin film from 1914, which was undoubtedly amusing. Upon realizing it has been 107 years, I felt a sense of emptiness knowing none of the characters are still alive. This led me to ponder: did they ever imagine someone would find entertainment in their work after over a century? It seems unlikely.</p>
<p> In today&#39;s context, with widespread insecurity due to the pandemic, our only option is to exercise caution and accept that we each traverse this path just once before becoming history. So, relax! It is merely a cycle - if not now, then later, we will all depart.</p>
<p> Until then, let us relish the journey and remember it is a gift, not an entitlement. Every journey is best appreciated in moments; take pleasure in your presence at this very instant.</p>
