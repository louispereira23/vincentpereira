          <p>Save for the Rainy Days</p>
<p> Upon hearing this phrase, one might instinctively brace for difficult times ahead. However, I have learned the art of enjoying the rain.</p>
<p> Why vilify rain, which is often associated with prosperity? Granted, the saying has become popular.
 While I&#39;m not against saving, as it does give one a sense of stability, it shouldn&#39;t come at the expense of relishing a sunny day. We must remember that the present we are in was once envisaged as our future.</p>
<p> It&#39;s worth noting that the concept of saving is a modern invention. In earlier times, there were no banks, stocks, or insurance - practically nothing. People were foragers and didn&#39;t even hoard food, yet they persevered.</p>
<p> In contrast, many contemporary individuals are so preoccupied with saving that they opt to live miserly only to pass away wealthy. I frequently remind my friends that what you earn isn&#39;t truly yours, but what you spend is.</p>
<p> So enjoy your sunny days and be wise enough to spend.
 Remember, it&#39;s one life, it&#39;s your life - make it worthwhile.</p>
