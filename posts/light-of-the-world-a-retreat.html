          <p>I am the light.</p>
<p> Back then, every diocesan school&#39;s tenth standard students attended a retreat at Bom Jesus, Old Goa, conducted by Fr. George D&#39;Sa. My batch was in 1975-76. The retreat, under the guise of the Light of the World movement, welcomed all faiths. Thus, my friend Ankush, a non-Catholic, and I, a casual Catholic practitioner, shared a room for one week.</p>
<p> Our friendship began in ninth grade when he shifted schools. Although his second language was Marathi and mine French, I ended up attending Marathi classes in defiance due to my differences with the French teacher. Our friendship blossomed over our shared rebellious attitudes. Our discussions often revolved around questioning life&#39;s purpose and exploring vague subjects.</p>
<p> Ankush&#39;s father owned a shop, so cigarettes were easily accessible. We&#39;d sit on separate branches of a tamarind tree in my backyard and discuss various topics. However, we didn&#39;t realize that our philosophical pursuits wouldn&#39;t help us in exams. As expected, we both failed our tenth grade, and to this day, I feel guilty for swaying his bright mind.</p>
<p> Returning to the retreat – as rebellious teenagers seeking answers and smoking in our room – one thing that influenced us was Jim Reeves&#39; morning song &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; and Fr. George&#39;s serene disposition. He entered our smoky room one morning with a knowing smile but said nothing; we stopped smoking for the remainder of the retreat.</p>
<p> On the penultimate day, an overwhelming candlelit oath-taking ceremony took place. I walked out feeling saintly but alas, it lasted no longer than a week. Nonetheless, I recognize the impact it had on me, though not permanent.</p>
