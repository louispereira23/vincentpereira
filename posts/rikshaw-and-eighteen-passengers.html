          <p>Eighteen passengers in one rickshaw (tuk-tuk) sounds impossible, but this was one record set on my island of Diwar.</p>
<p> As they say, necessity is the mother of invention. This necessity arose in the eighties, and we had to invent ways to commute. The three-kilometer ride from the mainland to the ferry point at Old Goa was a challenge. Ten of us squeezing together in one rickshaw was the norm, and each passenger knew their role. Newcomers were guided by regulars.</p>
<p> What strikes me today is that it was a genderless society - one could push themselves onto anyone&#39;s lap or hold any part for those three kilometers. There were no rules as long as one reached the destination. A variety of smells mixed with sweat created an unacceptable concoction, but one had to get used to it.</p>
<p> Not all passengers were saints; some looked forward to these rides for pleasures other than reaching their destination, often reciprocated. I used to opt for tempo rides, which were equally chaotic and suitable for pleasure - pun intended.</p>
<p> I gave up rickshaw rides after standing in one - yes, we stood! We held onto roof rails for support while standing on either side of the driver&#39;s open cabin to maintain balance. During one such ride, my head hit a protruding canopy from a cart while maneuvering a zigzag. Fortunately, it was made of bamboo rather than metal; otherwise, it could have been tragic.</p>
<p> This wild thought of writing these memories occurred when I noticed rickshaws no longer ply this route.&quot;</p>
