          <p>My Diary</p>
<p> For nearly a decade, I&#39;ve recorded my experiences, expectations, and candid thoughts based on the situations and surroundings I&#39;ve encountered.</p>
<p> Reviewing these entries, I marvel at the sheer volume and diversity of topics, despite some repetition and contradictions. This only reinforces that these writings are unfiltered reflections of my daily life.</p>
<p> Initially, organizing these notes wasn&#39;t a priority. However, a fortunate intuition and access to my son Louis&#39;s AudioPen app helped transform these scattered musings into coherent text. I am truly grateful for this invaluable tool.</p>
<p> These observations aim not to impress or persuade others without merit but to satisfy my curiosity. A random reading may serve a purpose; thus, I wish to share my thoughts with the ARMACARS young family members, showing them that life offers more than what&#39;s visible on the surface.</p>
<p> Additionally, I want to share these reflections with friends who have tolerated my intrusion through my postings and discussions of such observations over time.</p>
<p> Before printing these entries, I felt the need to reflect on my experiences and recall the moments that inspired them. This exercise confirmed that my life thus far at sixty-six has been akin to a roller coaster - sometimes up, sometimes down - but at no point have I regretted my existence. I strongly believe that every day is a new day, not a continuation of yesterday, and I remain excited to discover what tomorrow holds for me.</p>
<p> I express my heartfelt gratitude to my wife, Ruby, and my children, Golda and Louis. I sincerely thank them for allowing me to be myself.</p>
