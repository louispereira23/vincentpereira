          <p>What is faith, if not trusting oneself? Faith within ; would it not yield the same result? Why must we rely on others or religious doctrine? How entangled have we become in this web?</p>
<p> In good times, we often have faith in ourselves, believing it will endure. So why do we shift it during challenging times? Instead, let&#39;s channel that energy into a self-sufficient faith, unburdened by dependencies.</p>
<p> Facing reality becomes simpler with this approach. They say faith can move mountains, which means seeking answers within and shedding the weight of self-created obstacles. Each individual possesses the ability to discern expectations from possibilities and find peace. Yet societal norms lure us into believing in miracles.</p>
<p> While no one has complete control over life&#39;s challenges, we often seek external saviors. This mindset validates miracles and leaves us vulnerable to exploitation. To avoid this trap, have faith in your understanding and make decisions best suited for you.</p>
<p> Miracles or not, nothing lasts forever. Believing in oneself and maintaining faith until the end ‚Äì now that&#39;s a true miracle.</p>
