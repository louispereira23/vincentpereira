          <p>10th July 1928</p>
<p> A first child was born to the proud couple, Simao Luis Gomes and Catarina Aguiar. They named her Maria Antonia Gomes.</p>
<p> I imagine that day must have been filled with celebration. Simao likely called his friends and shared a drink of feni under a tree near his house in Maddant.</p>
<p> Maria was a beautiful child. Unfortunately, she contracted chickenpox at a young age, a dreadful illness in those days. With devoted care from her parents and her uncle Manuel Aguiar, she prevailed. The disease left scars on her lovely face, but her beauty remained intact.</p>
<p> Maria attended the local school, completing primary education. On 14th May 1949, at the age of 21, she married the handsome Luis Antonio Pereira. He was her neighbor but worked in Bombay. Their wedding took place at St. Xavier Church in Dabul.</p>
<p> After their marriage, Luis Antonio relocated to Goa. In their 23 years together, they had eleven children. Tragically, their eldest child Indira passed away as an infant. The remaining ten children persevered; I am one of them.</p>
<p> Our mother was a saint personified. By default, she inherited the name Aurora, which literally means &quot;the dawn.&quot; A fitting tribute to this remarkable woman who once graced this planet.</p>
<p> Happy Alor Day!</p>
