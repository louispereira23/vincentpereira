          <p>Peters: a name that rings a bell. On Sundays, we&#39;d visit not just because it was a bar, but because it was a place with a difference. It was here we would solve the world&#39;s problems within an hour.</p>
<p> As friends, it was our ritual to meet, though eventually, I had to drop a name from the list.</p>
<p> I walked that path alone, yet never felt lonely in my solitude. Something was in the air; all one needed was to be there.</p>
<p> A thousand times I visited, my seat even knew my name. But each time, it was different; it never stayed the same. Our sessions began at noon, often lasting past three. The gracious owner handed over the key.</p>
<p> Now Peters is closed, and I&#39;m told there&#39;s a wall. I haven&#39;t seen it and wished it was not to be. Not out of arrogance, but because I have my frozen memories sealed; one day, I know they&#39;ll be revealed.</p>
