          <p>I awoke as usual, yet something felt different. I noticed the birds chirping and could discern at least nine distinct melodies. This experience transported me back to my school days.</p>
<p> The morning rituals: grabbing my bag, walking the muddy road, feeling the mist in the air and the dampness on the weeds. The sound of the bell, and the hurried final steps to arrive on time for assembly. The punctuality of the first few days, with tidy books and completed homework, gave me a sense of pride that I had grown since the previous year – even if it only lasted a few weeks.</p>
<p> Singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; for a classmate, anticipating an extra share of sweets as their best friend. Attempting to impress girls in hopes of future courtship. All these memories seem so wonderful, yet I still longed for holidays back then. Now I wonder why – yes, I truly miss my school days.</p>
