          <p>The word &quot;more&quot; has become so fashionable that it nearly ridicules the concept of minimalism. With its unquenchable nature, one might question whether aspiring for more is a misguided pursuit. While I ponder this, I must admit that my answer may not be entirely conclusive.</p>
<p> There is nothing inherently wrong with seeking more, provided that one keeps in mind the value of minimalism. Striking a balance between ambition and simplicity helps maintain one&#39;s identity and sanity. Solely chasing after more by aping without appetite can lead to greed, potentially sabotaging one&#39;s peace of mind.</p>
<p> Minimalism need not imply scarcity; rather, it represents the precise amount needed for genuine contentment. Anything beyond that often serves as a means of seeking approval from society. This competitive mindset, focused on comparing oneself to others rather than personal growth, can result in restlessness.</p>
<p> Let us give minimalism its due credit. After all, being a minimalist doesn&#39;t mean owning nothing; it means ensures that nothing owns you.</p>
