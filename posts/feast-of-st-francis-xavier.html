          <p>As November approaches, the island of Diwar buzzes with anticipation for the novenas of St. Francis Xavier&#39;s Feast. In the 1970s, we would walk to the ferry, which connected us to a wonderland.</p>
<p> Back then, Goa was primarily inhabited by Goans, so the fair was mostly run by Goans with a few visitors selling religious items. We even had our own restaurant, POP INN, a fitting name for young entrepreneurs seeking enjoyment and profit. Our friends frequented the establishment, providing business and lending a helping hand just for the fun of it.</p>
<p> I remember the quote painted on the wall saying: &quot;IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO, THEN PLEASE DON&#39;T DO IT HERE&quot; - a bold reminder to our friends to be productive.</p>
<p> The highlight for me was the vespers night when less privileged individuals gathered to spend the evening with their local drum (ghumot), singing songs and attending the cross ladainha. A swig of local brew madachi feni kept spirits high. At dawn, they attended the feast day mass before making way for well-dressed attendees of the high mass.</p>
<p> A notable feature of vespers night was matchmaking expeditions. Young girls from that community dressed elegantly, their faces displaying shy anticipation of a brighter future, while their parents eagerly attempted to arrange marriages.</p>
<p> Nowadays, mobile phones have intruded upon this tradition. Nevertheless, I still attend vespers night in an effort to relive those cherished memories.</p>
