          <p>It can be rather amusing to observe one&#39;s shift in perception about a person or an organization. At times, the change of feelings can be quite dramatic, transforming someone from an angel to a devil. In such instances, a conscious mind might wonder why such a shift occurs.</p>
<p> This phenomenon demonstrates the biased nature of humans. We often draw conclusions without proper diligence and believe ourselves to be correct. We propagate our beliefs to others as if they were gospel truth, almost to the point of no return. However, when our expectations are not met by that person or group, we become frustrated and alter our perception in the opposite direction. In doing so, we paint the entire canvas without realizing that merit may exist in some actions of the once-adored individual.</p>
<p> When cornered, we activate bias and defend the indefensible. In such cases, it is crucial to amend our belief system and understand that every person possesses their own mindset. Their actions may not always meet our expectations, but before passing judgment, we should avoid bias and let merit prevail. As the saying goes, give the devil its due.</p>
