          <p>Opinion: A view or judgment on something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge. The intriguing part is that it&#39;s not always grounded in facts or knowledge. Pause for a moment and consider how opinionated you are, and how much it governs your thought process. How much of it is truly based on facts or knowledge? For myself, I find the answer to be less than fifty percent. So why should such notions dominate most of my life?</p>
<p> I&#39;ve resolved to refrain from being overly opinionated and to seek facts and knowledge before accepting a statement as true. This endeavor has cleared much clutter from my mental storage, invigorating my pursuit of knowledge. It has bolstered my confidence in admitting, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Furthermore, it has reinforced my belief that knowing you don&#39;t know is the essence of knowledge.</p>
<p> Many a time, opinion had deceived me into thinking it was knowledge.</p>
