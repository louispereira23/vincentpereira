          <p>When pondering parents&#39; aspirations for their children&#39;s future and fortune, a clear conclusion remains elusive. From the moment a child is born, the notion of a secure future, accompanied by fortune, takes center stage. This phenomenon primarily affects middle-class families, causing them to lose sight of the true purpose of having a child.</p>
<p> In focusing so intently on the future, parents often miss the present and their child&#39;s presence, leading to conditional love. This mindset essentially communicates, &quot;I will love you more if you meet my expectations.&quot; Such an attitude confuses children, and its effects manifest when they become adults, with love becoming conditional in reverse.</p>
<p> In pursuing fortune, we risk forfeiting our children&#39;s futures â€“ futures they should shape themselves. It is crucial to remember that love ought to be unconditional. Cherish your child simply because they are your creation, but do not claim ownership of their future. The &#39;run fast, run far&#39; attitude should change. We must remember that migration is a compromise one has to make due to circumstances pushing them or opportunities pulling them, but by no means is it a status symbol, which it is often mistaken to be. Guide them toward possibilities and recognize that having them close, both emotionally and geographically, is the true measure of fortune.</p>
