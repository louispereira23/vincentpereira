        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Often perceived as harmless, envy is, in fact, a silent killer. As the saying goes, envy corrodes the vessel that holds it. Many of us misunderstand envy, believing it to be discontent with oneself for not possessing what others have - wealth, fame, beauty, and so forth.</p>
<p> However, I cannot fully agree with this definition. How else can we explain the envy one billionaire has for another, one actor for their peer, or one beauty pageant contestant for their competitor? These individuals seemingly possess the same qualities, yet envy arises from their ignorance in truly knowing themselves. Instead, they rely on external validation.</p>
<p> To prevent this corrosion of your own vessel, invest time in self-discovery. Once you recognize your true self, envy will naturally dissipate. Remember that another&#39;s success is not your failure.</p>
