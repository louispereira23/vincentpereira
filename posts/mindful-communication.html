          <p>Communication is often taken for granted. </p>
<p> Most know it&#39;s a two-way process, but this is conveniently forgotten when one feels aggrieved and wants to counter instantly, sometimes without merit. </p>
<p> It&#39;s human to react in such a manner, but one must be mindful of the consequences, which can lead to breaking relationships. </p>
<p> It&#39;s fair to say that the main ingredient of a worthy relationship is good communication. </p>
<p> For good communication, it&#39;s important to listen rather than be in a hurry to respond or counter. </p>
<p> Otherwise, you might regret it later. </p>
<p> Most communication fails because we have pre-empted conclusions or preconceived notions about the person and not the subject. So, it&#39;s best to corroborate the subject mentally before responding.</p>
<p> As it&#39;s said, all that happens impacts you based on how you react to it. </p>
<p> Good communication keeps bias out and focuses on merit.</p>
