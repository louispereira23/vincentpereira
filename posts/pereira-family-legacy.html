 For Your Twenty-Two Great-Great-Grandchildren</p>
<p> The Legacy of Luis Francisco Pereira
 Luis Francisco Pereira, an entrepreneur and your great-great-grandfather, journeyed from Succor to Diwar Island in the early 19th century. Although I regret not knowing your great-great-grandmother&#39;s name, she likely found Diwar&#39;s beauty irresistible.</p>
<p> Their granddaughter, Isabel Cristalina Pereira, shared stories of walking with her grandmother between Diwar and Succor over Chorao&#39;s hills. They&#39;d stay overnight before returning with provisions from relatives.</p>
<p> Luis Francisco established a tavern at Diwar; its structure still stands at Toleacho Bandh (meaning &quot;embankment of a pond&quot;). He traveled to Succor weekly for supplies but later obtained a house from his father&#39;s employer to expand his business on the island. This led to the family&#39;s relocation to what is now Armacar Niwas.</p>
<p> Luis had one son, Jo√£o Caitano Pereira. Luis passed away young, and Jo√£o chose a seafaring career. During a trip home, he smuggled a gun, earning him the nickname &quot;Armacar&quot; (Konkani for &quot;gun possession&quot;), which has been proudly inherited since.</p>
<p> Jo√£o married Ana Maria Pascoal and had two children: Luis Antonio and Cristaline Isabel Pereira.
 Jo√£o, too, died young aboard ship. Thanks to the intervention of kind souls, a burial at sea was avoided, and he was laid to rest at the nearest European port.</p>
<p> A fortnight later, the family received a telegram in Portuguese, revealing the tragic news of Jo√£o Caitan&#39;s death from cholera and his land burial. This tale was recounted by his daughter, Cristalin, then around fifteen, and her brother Luis Antonio Pereira, a mere five years old.</p>
<p> Luis Antonio harbored one lingering regret: not knowing his father&#39;s final resting place. He would often speculate about European countries and yearned to visit them for closure. Sadly, it never came to pass.</p>
<p> Luis Antonio married Maria Antonia (Alor), and they were blessed with ten children‚Äîone of whom is your parent.</p>
<p> And thus unfolds the story of a house called Armacar Niwas.
 Whenever time permits,
 COME HOME.&quot;</p>
