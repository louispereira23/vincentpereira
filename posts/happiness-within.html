        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Dependent happiness often involves comparing ourselves to others and focusing on external factors. While it&#39;s natural to care about our relationships and the well-being of loved ones, it&#39;s crucial to recognise the importance of personal happiness.</p>
<p> Nowadays, society is fixated on the idea of being rich and famous. Most people don&#39;t think about the value of happiness.</p>
<p> True happiness comes from within, and we must allocate time for self-care and independent joy. Remember that when we pass away, our world goes with us. Therefore, make an effort to experience genuine contentment by dedicating a portion of your life exclusively to yourself.</p>
<p> That being said, once you share happiness with others, it magnifies. In return, partaking in others&#39; happiness sustains it.</p>
<p> Any endeavour one undertakes must please yourself. In other words, be selfish to be selfless.</p>
