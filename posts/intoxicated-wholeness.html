          <p>When I don&#39;t compare, I feel whole and complete. Curiously, this sense of completeness often occurs when I&#39;ve had a drink. A thought-provoking observation, considering I&#39;m not inebriated. Why does my self-belief seem to require a slightly altered state?</p>
<p> Perhaps it&#39;s because the world appears different when my mind is clear. Maybe the desire to please society influences my thoughts. Though uncertain, there&#39;s no denying that I feel distinct when slightly intoxicated â€“ more connected to myself and at ease with the circumstances of my existence.</p>
<p> Surrounded by life&#39;s abundance, I find joy in simple pleasures: Life can be contemplative, our thoughts shifting between sobriety and intoxication.</p>
<p> Wouldn&#39;t it be fascinating if the entire world experienced this state simultaneously? Perhaps that&#39;s why Jesus turned water into wine â€“ a divine concoction designed to bring happiness and elevate our spirits. Let us raise a glass to this concoction and embrace what some may call the Holy Spirit.</p>
