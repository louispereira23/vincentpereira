          <p>I often notice individuals praying fervently, seemingly due to insecurities. 
 It is essential to distinguish between what is within our control and what is not. Excessive prayer may, in fact, undermine our self-confidence. As the adage goes, God helps those who help themselves.</p>
<p> In essence, employ your intellect to recognize that many anxieties are self-generated; thus, the solutions or gratitude expressed reside within you. Prayer is not a transaction for a return but rather a process of reconciliation with oneself. This ultimately aids in accepting truth and allowing one&#39;s mind and body to live harmoniously. </p>
<p> Start living your prayers, for all the answers are within you.</p>
