          <p>November, a name that may vary in other languages, evokes a sense of festivity for me. Perhaps it is due to our chapel feast of the Lord Redeemer. I recall eagerly counting down the days a month in advance.</p>
<p> My route to school would shift to Golthechan, as I anticipated the first signs of festivity: the commencement of earth digging to install wooden poles for the shamiana. I remember the excitement of sharing this news with others. The following ten days would fly by, altering my routine. Indeed, it was the only time I&#39;d leave a football game early without remorse, and so would my peers.</p>
<p> The hot water bath from the Bhand, the aroma of straw that accompanied gushing water, my attire, and my spirited walk towards the chapel were all highlights. The petromax&#39;s filtered light illuminated the trees at varying degrees as I approached my destination. The choir&#39;s harmonious sound and the tempting smell of bhajjas mingled with naphthalene balls, indicating the presence of clothes that had been stored for almost a year. Despite struggling to fit into one-year-old shoes, the thrill of being there made it worthwhile.</p>
<p> However, this November feels different. The pandemic has taken its toll; people have surrendered to self-invited gloom. The village appears in mourning, lamenting its first fatalityâ€š once just a statistic but now a personal tragedy.</p>
<p> As someone who believes life is meant to be lived fully, not merely survived, I am eager to bring back festivity. With necessary precautions in place, on November 15th, I will attend the Redemptor Saibachem Fest at Armacar Niwas.</p>
