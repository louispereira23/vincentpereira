          <p>At a colleague&#39;s funeral, I found myself standing before the niche of Maria Carlotta de Rego Aguiar. I&#39;d seen this face many a times but today it dawned on me that she is my great-grandmother on my mother&#39;s side. It brought home the fact that I owe my existence to this woman â€“ a sobering realization indeed.</p>
<p> Looking around at lifelong friends attending mass with me, it was clear how time had etched its mark on us all. Our shapes altered, walks slowed and looks changed; life is certainly different from our youthful days.</p>
<p> Gazing at the church, I pondered if my great-grandmother had walked this very path when things were starkly different. Being in our shared birthplace felt like an indulgence; connecting myself to several generations rooted here made me feel deeply native.</p>
<p> Today reinforced that embracing one&#39;s roots creates a strong sense of belonging, something we often neglect but should cherish instead.</p>
