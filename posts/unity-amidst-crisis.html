          <p>22nd March 2020
 This day was truly exceptional.
 The dawn was unusually quiet, devoid of mechanical noise.
 Nature took control.
 The sky was clearer, and the crescent moon seemed to smile, as if saying, &quot;Now you know.&quot;
 The poor felt rich as wealth lost its meaning.</p>
<p> Indeed, humans quarantined themselves to combat the coronavirus.</p>
<p> Neighbors united while staying apart,
 The Gods cooperated, absolving the faithful from rituals.</p>
<p> This effort, dubbed Janata Curfew,
 Was not enforced but voluntarily observed for humanity&#39;s sake.</p>
<p> It was a national call,
 India uniting without religion, caste, or political ideology.</p>
<p> This intrigues me.
 Why are we divided during prosperity,
 Yet united in crisis?
 As humans, we desire a happy life,
 And that is what truly matters.
 We should not need a virus to awaken us.
 Perhaps this lesson, learned the hard way,
 Promises better days ahead.</p>
