          <p>From time to time, I find myself reminiscing about particular incidents, and I felt the urge to record one such memory. My academic journey from high school to earning two degrees was rather challenging, so much so that I nearly dropped out in the tenth grade. This wasn&#39;t due to a lack of intelligence, but rather a lack of enthusiasm and focus. Nonetheless, I carried on.</p>
<p> One day, I resolved to reevaluate my life. I purchased a cigarette pack at the GMC canteen and sat in the nearby park, then known as the children&#39;s park. As the fresh air quickened my cigarette&#39;s burn, I pondered my future without pressure. This introspection brought to mind my father&#39;s hopes for me - to become a lawyer. It was a sudden realisation that put me back on course.</p>
<p> Though unable to attend daily classes, I compensated by studying intensely in the college library a month before exams. This pattern persisted until I completed law school. The flashback inspiring this writing took place during my first year of law exams.</p>
<p> Frequent library visits at law college familiarized me with college staff, whose casual demeanor influenced me during exams and made me overly relaxed. After completing all my papers, I awaited the results. To my dismay, the results indicated me , Absent and while the one ahead of me passed. I knew the surrounding benches were empty; therefore, it must have been me who occupied his seat.
 Proving this was difficult since all records showed he had answered.</p>
<p> The only solution was obtaining a declaration from the actual absentee student and having it endorsed by the college. Thus, I tracked him down to his bank job in Bicholim. Upon asking about him, everyone shouted his name: &quot;Parsekar hanga yo!&quot; ; They were all aware of this mix-up.</p>
<p> He kindly signed the declaration without hesitation and advised me to be cautious since things could have been worse.</p>
<p> Since then, I&#39;ve attempted not to be too casual in my endeavors â€“ though admittedly, I am still only halfway there.</p>
