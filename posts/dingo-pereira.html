          <p>Who is Dingo? May his soul rest in peace. I generally avoid this phrase, but for Dingo, I&#39;ll make an exception.</p>
<p> Our family, the Pereiras, can only trace our lineage to my father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. Our family tree appears rather linear before us - six brothers and four sisters. Regrettably, sisters cannot continue the Pereira name due to historical convention.</p>
<p> Our father, Luis Antonio Pereira, was eager to learn about his ancestors. His grandfather had to abandon his birthplace because of some issues, I am told. Luis frequently visited his ancestral land, seeking connections to the Pereira family tree with no success.</p>
<p> During a Bombay trip, he encountered a man named Dingo Pereira over drinks. Noticing their shared surname and location, Luis thought he had found a family link. He told this tale to his sister Isabel Cristalin D&#39;Sa (Pereira by birth), who was delighted by the discovery. She confidently shared it with us whenever possible. Isabel survived our father by twenty-three years, even though she was ten years older.</p>
<p> She always maintained her maiden surname as Pereira in all conversations. She wanted her coffin&#39;s name plaque to mention it, and I ensured it did. Her loyalty to that name was strong, so her excitement over finding a link to her ancestor was understandable. Although we suspected our father merely comforted her, we didn&#39;t contest her claim.</p>
<p> Twenty-seven years after Isabel&#39;s death and fifty years after my father&#39;s demise, while paying homage on his golden death anniversary, we were examining old family portraits when an inquiry surfaced about Dingo&#39;s identity. It was then that I silently wished: whoever he may be, may his soul rest in peace.</p>
