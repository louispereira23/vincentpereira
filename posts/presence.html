          <p>Reading these reflections, one might think I&#39;m stuck in the past, nostalgic for the 70s and 80s. But I live in the present, grateful for how my past shaped today. I focus on the now rather than dwelling on the future.</p>
<p> So why do my most vivid memories come from thirty years ago? The last 35 years have brought many blessings: marriage, children, prosperity, and respect. Life has gotten better. Perhaps I was less conscious of my goals then; I moved through life more instinctively.</p>
<p> My cherished memories come from times when I was truly present. Today, life moves so fast that we often miss the journey, fixating only on the destination. Once there, we immediately look to the next goal, never fully experiencing the moment. This might explain why those earlier years remain so clear in my memory.</p>
