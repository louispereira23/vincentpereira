          <p>During a casual conversation with a friend, we both discovered our shared love for dogs. My friend mentioned that they changed their floor tiles to brown because they didn&#39;t want to see the dirt their dog brought in. However, I have white tiles and my dog comes in often as well. Instead of hiding the dirt, I prefer cleaning it up.</p>
<p> Over time, it became difficult to clean the dirt every time my dog came inside. So I adjusted my mindset and started viewing my dog&#39;s paw prints as works of art, which put me at ease until it&#39;s cleaned. This change made me question if I was genuinely embracing this new perspective or just doing so out of convenience.</p>
<p> Ultimately, who is right? Should one install brown tiles to mask the dirt or keep white ones that display paw prints more visibly? The answer remains uncertain.</p>
