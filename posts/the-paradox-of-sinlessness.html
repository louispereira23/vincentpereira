          <p>A truly sinless life, if taken to its logical extreme, would be utterly devoid of value. Yet we often strive to adhere to such moral standards, thereby embracing hypocrisy at its core. Sins, as we call them, include lust, lies, and cheating.</p>
<p> If these acts did not exist, life would be rather dull. Without lust, there would be little incentive to dress well. To understand lies, one must first question the nature of truth and the extent to which it should be communicated. Cheating is subjective, since anything kept secret can be interpreted as deceitful. Secrets often form the backbone of business and professional endeavors.</p>
<p> These few examples illustrate the difficulty of living a sinless life. It is safe to say that anyone claiming to live without sin is committing a sin itself. So why vilify these acts that are commonplace in everyday life? Is it merely for the sake of earning heavenly merit?</p>
<p> Try living just one day without sinful thoughts, actions, or words. Chances are you&#39;ll find yourself longing for hellish pursuits instead.</p>
<p> Don&#39;t fret over sins as they have been portrayed.
 Perhaps it&#39;s time for an amendment: simply learn to live comfortably within your conscience.</p>
