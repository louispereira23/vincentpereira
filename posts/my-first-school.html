          <p>Attempting to recall my first day at school yields little success, yet I do remember one of my initial days. My school, a Marathi medium establishment, was situated within a temple around 1965. The only supplies required were a slate, known as &#39;paty,&#39; and a chalk pencil called &#39;kadi.&#39;</p>
<p> Kindergarten, or &#39;opri&#39; in Marathi, was one among five classes sharing one hall and one teacher - a recipe for chaos. Each class rhythmically recited lessons or tables, taking turns copying from the board based on the teacher&#39;s discretion.</p>
<p> During that time, education was primarily between students and teachers; parents played minimal roles. There were no parent-teacher meetings, and educators were free to discipline students as they saw fit - occasionally causing pain.</p>
<p> After studying in Marathi until third grade, I transitioned to an English medium school, repeating the third grade and losing an academic year. Comparing today&#39;s schooling with our past experiences reveals stark contrasts. While I cannot dispute the quality of modern education, our era&#39;s schooling undoubtedly fostered resilience for facing the future.</p>
