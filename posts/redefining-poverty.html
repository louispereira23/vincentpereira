        <div class="post-content">
          <p>In today&#39;s world, the focus on alleviating poverty often revolves around material poverty. We tend to think of poverty mostly as a lack of food, shelter, and clothing, and leaders and religious figures emphasize serving the poor as a noble act. However, I must ask: what makes one feel wealthy enough to serve the poor? If we only view poverty as material, then perhaps having extra money qualifies us to help.</p>
<p> But there is more to poverty than material circumstances; lack of attitudes such as gratitude, integrity, and equality contributes to the poverty of mindset. Some people may have enough but still feel poor, or their concern for others&#39; well-being diminishes if someone else has more. This mindset must also be addressed.</p>
<p> The notion of poverty extends beyond materialism. It isn&#39;t solely about financial aid or empathy for those with less; sometimes, those we deem &quot;poor&quot; possess a richer attitude towards life than their wealthier counterparts. We must recognize that we are all impoverished in our own ways.</p>
