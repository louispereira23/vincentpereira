          <p>Equitable and equal may sound similar, but there is a significant difference between the two, particularly in the realm of business. We often proclaim that everyone is equal when it comes to agreements or official documents. However, one must accept that equality does not always yield the desired outcome. It is equity that makes things work.</p>
<p> In certain situations, strictly adhering to a document can hinder progress. For instance, it&#39;s akin to asking a chef not to taste their food for fear they might consume it. In the world of business, everything is negotiable unless it negatively impacts the system or diminishes value. Thus, it is crucial to embrace equity rather than solely focusing on equality.</p>
<p> The famous legal maxim states: &#39;The law is equal for all men, but all men are not equal before the law.&#39;</p>
