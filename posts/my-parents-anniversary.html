          <p>Today is a special day in my life, as it&#39;s not only Mother&#39;s Day but also the wedding anniversary of my parents. I recently came across their marriage details written by our father in our family Bible, and it has made me quite nostalgic.</p>
<p> Though I knew they married young, the records confirmed that our dad was 24 and our mother just 21 when they tied the knot in Bombay. I&#39;m unsure about how many people from Diwar attended their wedding, but I know that my auntie and my mother&#39;s family were present.</p>
<p> The expectations during that era were different; companionship seemed to be more important than high ambitions. This makes me reflect on how sometimes small things matter much more than what we can hold on to in life.</p>
