          <p>This phrase, often employed to console, seems to be on autopilot these days. We must thank whoever initiated this comforting expression, as it has undoubtedly simplified our lives. Yet, having used it countless times, I find myself questioning its meaning and my authority to wish such a thing for the deceased.</p>
<p> What is the soul? My search began with the dictionary, which defines it as the spiritual and immaterial part of a human being, regarded as immortal. This immortality implies that the soul is endless. Thus, another question arises: what does peace mean for something infinite?</p>
<p> In our world, we experience peace when we recognize and overcome its opposites â€“ violence, chaos, unrest, confusion, etc. Therefore, peace cannot be endless. Since the soul is immortal, it seemingly disqualifies from experiencing eternal peace. So I decided to abandon the phrase altogether.</p>
<p> This realization led me to ponder why we feel anguish over death. Ultimately, death signifies the end of everything for the deceased; we have no authority to wish them anything but to remember their deeds fondly if they inspire positive feelings.</p>
<p> However, we tend not to practice this because our emotions focus on what we lose when someone dies and what we may miss after our own demise. Thus, it has more to do with ourselves than the departed.</p>
<p> Rather than wishing for souls to rest in peace after death, perhaps it is more fitting to ask ourselves: how content is my soul while I am alive and well?</p>
