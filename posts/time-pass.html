          <p>Upon retirement; individuals often grapple with detaching from the routine imposed by their profession, which nearly stripped them of their identity. Consequently, the phrase &quot;time pass&quot; frequently arises. But what does it genuinely imply?</p>
<p> It is essential to acknowledge our inability to control time, as it waits for no one. </p>
<p> In moments of idleness, refrain from lamenting boredom and instead embrace the freedom to pursue your desires, which were once hindered by work obligations. Now, seize the chance to learn the art of enjoying your own company, you won&#39;t feel lonely though you may be alone your cherished memories will come to your rescue.</p>
<p> This provides mental nourishment and aids in remaining present in each moment. Be vigilant not to squander even a minute without full engagement, for wasting sixty seconds means forfeiting valuable opportunities.</p>
<p> In future instances of time pass, remind yourself that every day is a new day and not a continuation of yesterday.</p>
